### 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment (Whova)

This responsibility focuses on setting up important virtual events on the Whova system.

Duties include setting up the virtual environment (hosting, pricing, websites, Underline linking, accounts, etc.) as much as possible before the conference. Following this, Virtual Chair duties primarily consist of being reactive and available the week before the conference to finalize and adapt to new information (e.g., ACL Anthology links, schedule updates, etc.,). During the conference, Virtual Chairs must be alert to address any issues that may arise pertaining to virtual infrastructure.
