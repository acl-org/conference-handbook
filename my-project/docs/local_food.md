# Local organization - arranging the food and the social events

## Food

Refreshments at morning and afternoon breaks.
Possibly, lunch package (buffet or box lunches) often reserved on the conference registration form.
Make sure there are good vegetarian dishes and snacks.

## Social events

- Reception: in a nice area close to the main event, on the night before the main event. Include one or two drinks free.
- Social event: traditionally, in an unusual or nice setting (museum, garden, etc.). The social event should be self-financed (either by tickets alone or by being supplemented by sponsorships). Tickets generally do not run over $45 per person (at the most!).
- Entertainment: traditionally, at the social event, for dancing
- Excursion(s) (possibly): on the tutorial day and/or one day before/after conference, or during, for conference families
- ACL Exec Dinner: The Exec usually holds a dinner for about 50 people, in a location possibly off-campus. This should be arranged with the ACL Secretary.
- Post-conference breakfast: chairs of the conference and the next year's conference get together to share information. This is typically held at the main hotel on one day after the main conference.
