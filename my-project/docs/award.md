### 2. Managing Nominations and Reviews  

Reviewers*, Area Chairs (ACs), and Senior Area Chairs (SACs) must be asked the following questions pertaining to the nomination of papers for awards:
1. "Could the camera-ready version of this paper merit consideration for an "outstanding paper" award (up to 2.5% of accepted papers will be recognized in this way)? Outstanding papers should be either fascinating, controversial, surprising, impressive, or potentially field-changing. Awards will be decided based on the camera-ready version of the paper." [Yes/No/Maybe]\
2. "If yes/maybe, please briefly describe why:" [Short answer box without word/character limit]

\* Publication Chairs may decide whether to include reviewers in nomination decisions.

| Task                       | Start                                  | Deadline | Dependency | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### 3. Organizing the Selection Process 

The process below was developed based on the assumption that the nomination process leads to 50-80 papers being considered for awards. If the number of nominated papers turns out to be much higher, this process will not scale. Best paper award chairs have latitude and discretion for the design of the selection process. PCs should approve the process.

**Whilst a specific rubric is not defined, committee members should consider the following aspects when reviewing award nominees:**
1. Is each paper either fascinating, controversial, surprising, impressive, or potentially field-changing? Note that papers do not need to demonstrate all of these properties; any property is sufficient.
2. Does the paper present as its motivating use case an application with significant negative social impact? Even if the motivating use case is an application with neutral or positive social impact, are there obvious applications with significant negative social impact which are left unaddressed or insufficiently addressed by the paper? (In such cases, the paper should not be an award candidate.)
3. Is the work presented in the paper reproducible? For example, is there sufficient information in the paper to repeat the experiments? If not, is the lack of reproducibility justified in the paper?
4. Do the awards highlight a broad range of research types and strengths?
5. Do the awards include types of research that can be conducted at small labs?
6. Do the awards include papers that show excellence in potential positive social impact?

- Long/short papers should be considered jointly for awards. 
- Additional "Best Paper" and "Outstanding Paper" award slots are available for non-publicized papers.
