### 4. Press/Media Interaction

This responsibility concerns interacting with local media outlets to gain broader publicity for the conference. The Press is usually interested in the following topics:
* Major breakthroughs that change society
* Famous invited speakers
* Unusual/Unique Demo/Event

At ACL 2010 in Sweden, a local TV station interviewed several attendees. It does not hurt to contact relevant parties even if none of the above are explicitly present at the conference, in order to garner potential interest.
