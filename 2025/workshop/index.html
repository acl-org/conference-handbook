<h2 id="overview-of-responsibilities">Overview of Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The Workshop Chair is responsible for collaborating with the Workshop chairs for other ACL-affiliated conferences in a given year, in preparing and circulating the Call for Proposals, and in reviewing submissions.</p>
<p>Once the workshops for a given conference have been identified, the Workshop Chair is responsible for arranging dates, locations, refreshments, presentation and computer requirements, and all other special needs. It is essential that the Workshop Chair recognizes the different kinds of workshops and understand the policies regarding each. There are several categories of ACL workshops:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshops associated with conferences and formally sponsored by an ACL SIG.</li>
<li>Workshops associated with conferences but not formally sponsored by an ACL SIG.</li>
<li>Workshops formally sponsored by an ACL SIG but not associated with an ACL conference.</li>
<li>Workshops that are neither formally sponsored by a SIG nor associated with an ACL conference.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following are the main responsibilities of the Workshop Chairs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Cross-Committee Coordination</strong>\
<strong>2. Managing Communication with ACL Workshop Organizers</strong>\
<strong>3. Workshop Infrastructure and Planning</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="breakdown-of-responsibilities">Breakdown of Responsibilities</h2>
<h3 id="1-cross-committee-coordination">1. Cross-Committee Coordination</h3>
<p>In recent years, the selection of workshops has been made in unison with other conferences such as NAACL, EACL, AACL, EMNLP, etc. as appropriate. This helps ensure a variety of topics across conference locations and creates a more diverse pool for submissions. However, the conference-specific workshop chair will need to coordinate with the local chair to understand room availability (e.g., how many workshops are there room for).</p>

<p>Notes on the Workshop Selection Process:
- Large workshops are pre-admitted: *SEM, WMT, CoNLL, other workshops that will have more than 100 participants (SemEval). However, the chairs need to get their venue preferences for the year.
- Hold an online survey among ACL members (get mailing list from the ACL Office) asking them to indicate which workshops they would likely attend.
- Consideration criteria include: Past interest, interest according to the survey, diversity, quality of the organizing team, size of the workshop, and novelty.</p>
