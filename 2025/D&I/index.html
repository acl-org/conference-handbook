<h2 id="overview-of-responsibilities">Overview of Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The D&amp;I Chairs at *CL conferences are responsible for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion by ensuring accessibility, fostering a welcoming environment, and addressing the needs of underrepresented groups within the conference community. Additionally, they must address special requests, such as wheelchair rentals and sign language interpretation, and collaborate with the local chairs to ensure these needs are met.</p>
<p><strong>The following are the main responsibilities of the D&amp;I Chairs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. D&amp;I Sponsorship and Cross-Committee Coordination</strong>\
<strong>2. D&amp;I Registration Subsidy Allocation</strong>\
<strong>3. Activity Management (Birds of a Feather and Affinity Groups)</strong>\
<strong>4. Help with Accessibility and Special Accommodations</strong>\
<strong>5. (Optional) Organize Lunch with ACL Fellows</strong></p>
<p>An excellent additional resource for D&amp;I chairs is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIbRAjpptNDsBDFE-m0rfm_HINdqXg_mhb1EZg9P2zI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.3u8zqogyf5cw">this guide</a> compiled by Sabine Weber.</p>

<h3 id="2-di-registration-subsidy-allocation">2. D&amp;I Registration Subsidy Allocation</h3>
<p>D&amp;I subsidies consist of registration, caregiving, bandwidth, travel, and VPN subsidies. ACL strongly encourages researchers from developing countries and marginalized communities, students, and researchers with financial hurdles to apply for both D&amp;I subsidies and volunteering opportunities to maximize their chances of waiving their registration fees.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Registration Subsidy Note:</strong> Discounted virtual registration may be offered to low-income virtual attendees, and this is funded by ACL rather than the D&amp;I budget. There are the following exceptions: (1) Authors with accepted papers, (2) Employed/funded individuals/students from: the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and higher-income countries in Asia and the Middle East. The timeline approximately follows that shown below. However, there is no funding cap (pending approval from the ACL Executive Committee) - chairs should determine the level of subsidy for Virtual registration on a per-applicant basis (inc. whether or not to waive the ACL membership fee). Further, these subsidies may be offered in some cases to presenting authors who did not receive a standard D&amp;I subsidy or have other extenuating circumstances. We recommend connecting with the ACL Equity Director before releasing the Call for Virtual Registration Subsidies to ensure alignment on application questions and selection criteria.</p>

You may consider putting some applicants on a waitlist instead of rejecting them to account for this possibility. <strong>(5)</strong> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15z4yPPu1jdWP_V7dsk97i_n4jM0gPQXi">Notification Templates</a>.</td>

<h4 id="additional-noteslessons-learned">Additional notes/lessons learned:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bringing Children to the Conference:</strong></li>
<li>At some past conferences, children were not allowed at the venue without a registration badge, which is disappointing and unexpected for many attendees. Raise the question of children‚Äôs access to the venue and receptions with the ACL team (Jenn Rachford), the PC chairs, and the venue <strong>well in advance</strong>. </li>
<li>Children‚Äôs access policies need to be clearly stated in the registration form and on the website: what rooms will children be allowed in? What kind of registration will they need (if any), and what kind of registration is needed for a family member/partner who is caring for a small child?</li>
<li>If a registration fee is needed to give children and accompanying family members access to the venue, the D&amp;I team can consider offering childcare subsidies for this.</li>
<li><strong>Closed Captioning:</strong></li>
<li>If closed captioning is provided, make sure attendees will know how to access captions (if they can‚Äôt be shown live onscreen).</li>
<li>Underline should be able to share QR codes before plenary sessions for this, but be sure to ask ahead of time.</li>
<li><strong>D&amp;I Room Allocation:</strong> </li>
<li>Make sure the D&amp;I-related rooms are clearly and visibly promoted at the venue.</li>
<li>The venue will likely have various screens to direct people, and the information for these may be sent weeks in advance (contact ACL Business Team to ask them to include D&amp;I rooms in this).</li>
<li>Room locations can also be announced on Whova for more visibility.</li>
<li>Check that the physical signage and the online announcements explain each room‚Äôs purpose clearly (e.g., that the quiet room serves as a break space for attendees with sensory issues and is not for working).</li>
<li><strong>Dietary restrictions:</strong></li>
<li>Work with the venue to ensure food for attendees with dietary restrictions (e.g., Halal) is clearly labeled. Find out which food labels suit each dietary requirement (e.g., vegetarian dishes were also Halal at Austria Center Vienna).</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt print dietary restrictions on name badges: some labels (e.g., Halal) may indicate the participant‚Äôs religion, which they may not want to publicly disclose.</li>
<li><strong>Registration Form Questions:</strong></li>
<li>The ‚Äúmentoring‚Äù questions on the registration form (‚ÄúDo you have any interest in being a mentor/being mentored?‚Äù) are typically not followed up on. <ul>
<li>At ACL 2025, we forwarded the responses to the ACL year-round mentoring team (who used them to promote a mentoring event at ACL 2025).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Still, nothing is being done to match mentors and mentees. We recommend either:<ul>
<li>Changing the question to a more generic one, like ‚Äúare you interested in mentoring events at the conference?‚Äù, or</li>
<li>Starting a matching process for mentors and mentees. It might help to make the questions a bit clearer; this isn‚Äôt a long-term, formal mentoring relationship, but simply a ‚Äúbuddy system‚Äù that pairs new conference attendees with experienced conference attendees.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3 id="5-optional-organize-lunch-with-acl-fellows">5. (Optional) Organize Lunch with ACL Fellows</h3>
<p>Introduced at EMNLP 2024, this optional activity allows D&amp;I awardees to meet with ACL Fellows for networking that they may otherwise not be able to access. This should be funded by the D&amp;I budget, and can be a great way to spend unused budget (e.g., if any D&amp;I Subsidy awardees failed to secure a visa or dropped out at the last minute).</p>
