## Satellite Events

ACL conferences will have a "Satellite Events Only Fee" allowing a person who is not registered for the main conference to attend its satellite events (such as tutorials, workshops, or co-located conferences). The fee will be 1/3 of the cost of the main conference fee. This fee is intended to recoup the costs associated with running the conference that enables the satellite events to be held.
