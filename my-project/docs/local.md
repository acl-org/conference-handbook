# Local Organization Chair

## Overview

The Local Organization Chair, responsible for overseeing and coordinating all the meeting, accommodation, entertainment, and eating arrangements, is a key person for the success of the conference.
Much depends on his or her organizational talent and the quality of the Local Organization Committee assembled to help.
The Local Organization Chair can work with a local professional organizer, but the cost of this must be built into the conference budget.

The Local Organization Chair (assisted by the Local Organization Committee) has the following responsibilities.

- Choosing the conference venue and dates, to be included in the initial bid (see [Bid Guidelines](bid_guidelines.md)).
- Arranging the spaces for the conference meetings, including:
  - auditorium and meeting halls
  - system demonstration spaces
  - breakout session rooms
  - workshop rooms
  - tutorial rooms
  - exhibit space
  - registration area
  - email room (if needed)
  - meeting room for ACL Exec
  - wireless internet access for conference participants. Make sure that arrangements are as convenient as possible for users of all types of computer and all ports and services that can be accommodated.
- Negotiating with provider(s) of accommodations: hotel and/or dormitory organizers. Centrally, this involves negotiating a contract for the services provided, with financial guarantees. The ACL Office has considerable experience in this area.
- Handling AV needs of presenters (conference, workshops, tutorials) as well as the needs of system demos. This includes projection equipment, microphones, blackboards, writing materials, internet access, etc.
- Selecting and organizing food (refreshments during the conference; meals for ACL Exec and other meetings, etc.). The ACL Office is very experienced at negotiating with hotels about in-conference catering. Discuss plans with the Office before finalizing, it may be able to get a much better deal than someone with less experience.
- Organizing all additional activities, including:
  - the social event (location and food)
  - the reception(s)
  - entertainment at/after the social event (and elsewhere). ACL policy is that the social event should include a live band for dancing.
- Arranging any local excursions, for example pre-conference tours or tours for spouses (if provided)
- Providing travel information (airport, weather, medical, visas)
- Arranging local transport, if needed
- Arranging local support, including:
  - a support team, that helps both before the conference (to prepare registration materials) and during (with registration and attendee questions) and after (for teardown)
  - a suitable person to act as Volunteer co-ordinator to act as a focal point for volunteers
  - a suitably secure registration area, with computer and printer and internet access
  - signage to rooms, meetings, etc., as needed
  - several notice boards: participant messages, job postings, official announcements, etc.
- Prepare brochure and other promotional materials for the conference
- Supervise the building of the local web site
- Have communications with Publication Chairs, Website Chairs, and Handbook Chairs since they need local information and the schedule.
