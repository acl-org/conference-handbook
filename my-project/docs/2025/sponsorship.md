### 2. Sponsorship Outreach & Negotiation 

This responsibility focus on contacting and collecting funding from two kinds of sources: granting institutions and corporations.

For granting institutions, the lead time of institution grant is approximately 1 year. A formal proposal is usually required. Many funding institutions are unwilling to fund a conference more than once. Examples:

+ Sloan Foundation
 
Corporations must be approached several times:

+ the first time more than a year in advance, to ensure that the sponsorship is included on the budget for the next year;
+ six or so months before the conference, to re-awaken interest and stress the advertising potential
+ three months in advance, to handle the funds
