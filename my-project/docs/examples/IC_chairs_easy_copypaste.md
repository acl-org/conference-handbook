Just a file to conveniently copy paste the related emails per chairs /subjects.

Just triple click on the code blocks and then CTRL + C, then CTRL + V in the destination field in the Freshdesk, then ENTER

This process is way\~ faster than using the autocompletion from freshdesk (often missing members) or the online excel (sometimes tedious copy paste).
