# Local Organization Chair

## Overview

The Local Organization Chair, responsible for overseeing and coordinating all the meeting, accommodation, entertainment, and eating arrangements, is a key person for the success of the conference.

The Local Organization Chair (assisted by the Local Organization Committee) has the following responsibilities:
