# Selecting Chairs

The coordinating committee formed by the ACL exec is responsible for selecting General Chair and Program Chairs.

## Selecting a General Chair

The General Chair of the main ACL conference should have:

- experience from at least one (preferably two) of the following conference chair roles:
    - Program Chair of a *major* international conference in Computational Linguistics or a related area
    - Local Arrangements Chair of an international conference in Computational Linguistics or a related area
    - General Chair of an international conference in Computational Linguistics or a related area
- a proven capacity for leadership, including good organizational, collaborative and communicative skills.

When appointing a General Chair, the coordinating committee should in addition consider the following:

- ACL wants to promote equality and diversity in the selection of conference chairs.
- The General Chair should normally have an affiliation in the geographical region where the conference takes place.
- Candidates who have already been General Chair of the main ACL conference should normally not be considered again.
- Candidates with experience only from conferences in related areas, not Computational Linguistics, should normally not be considered.

**NB**: As *major* CL conferences are counted ACL, NAACL, EACL, AACL, IJCNLP, COLING, LREC and EMNLP.

- To aid in the selection process, see this list of [past conference chairs](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/Conference_Chairs)

Conferences in related areas include, for example, IJCAI, AAAI, NIPS, ICML, ICWSM, CHI, and CSCW.

For information about roles and responsibilities, see [General Chair duties](general.md).

**NB**: ACL is committed to promoting equity and diversity at all levels of the organization.

## Selecting Program Co-Chairs

The Program Committee of the main ACL conference is chaired by two or more Program Co-Chairs.
The Co-Chairs should have:

- experience as Area Chair for a major conference in Computational Linguistics or a related area,
- standing as an internationally recognized researcher in Computational Linguistics or a related area,
- good organizational, collaborative and communicative skills.

When appointing Program Co-Chairs, the coordinating committee should in addition consider the following:

- ACL wants to promote equality and diversity in the selection of conference chairs.
- The Program Co-Chairs should have complementary profiles, scientifically as well as socio-geographically
- Candidates who have already been Program Co-Chair of ACL should normally not be considered for the same conference.
- Candidates with experience only from conferences in related areas, not Computational Linguistics, should normally not be considered.

**NB**: As *major* CL conferences are counted ACL, NAACL, EACL, AACL, IJCNLP, COLING, LREC and EMNLP.
Conferences in related areas include, for example, IJCAI, AAAI, NIPS, ICML, CHI, and CSCW.
