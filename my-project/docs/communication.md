# Internal Communication Chair

The main task of the internal communication chairs is to triage incoming mails sent to the conference organizers and / or PC chairs (it is common practice to use mailing lists and aliases, e.g. acl2024-programchairs@googlegroups.com, to contact organizers or chairs). 

Emails sent to the conference mailing list can also be forwarded to some mail management portal (aka ticket management software) such as [Freshdesk](https://www.freshworks.com/fr/freshdesk/) so that chairs can supervise the procedure. Note that the ACL Rolling Review team has set up an ACL account on Freshdesk. [Jonathan Kummerfeld](https://jkk.name/) is the person in charge of this account.

When triaging emails through Freshdesk, a filter is added to sort emails (i.e. separate mails concerning submissions / ACL Rolling Review from mails concerning other matters).

Two internal communication co-chairs are usually appointed to share the workload. One way to coordinate triaging is to use an online shared folder (e.g. on a drive) containing the list of Conference chairs and the following files :

- a shared calendar where each of the communication chairs can indicate her/his availabilities ;
- an internal FAQ where each of the communication chairs can copy/paste already answered questions.

In some cases, two mailing lists are used by conference chairs (one for questions related to paper submission and one for all other questions). This may lead to emails sent to the wrong address.

On top of emails, several other communication channels between chairs are generally used (e.g. instant messaging / slack channels). It is important to define how to best communicate with each other (i.e. which channel to prioritize).

Some recommendations :

- use some long-lasting editing facility (e.g. the ACL wiki) to share the internal FAQ so that communication chairs can benefit from work done at previous editions ;
- have a local contact point for visa questions as early as possible in order to be able to direct questions appropriately and get concrete information ;
- share a common retro-planning (timeline) with the main dates regarding not only the publication process but also the conference organization (many people will ask when will registration be open, or when will the information about presentation guidelines available, etc.). It would be helpful to announce these dates on the conference website as soon as possible (or at least to share them with communication chairs).
