### 3.  Reviewing & Acceptance Decisions  

This responsibility encompasses managing the peer‑review workflow. Chairs assign reviewers, monitor the review period, encourage discussion—especially on borderline or conflicting reviews—and finally render balanced accept/reject decisions.

### 4.  Proceedings & Programme Coordination  

This responsibility focuses on integrating accepted demos into the conference experience. Tasks include preparing the companion proceedings, collecting presenters’ technical needs (hardware & software), and coordinating with General/Program Chairs to schedule demonstration sessions.


The Demo Chair should work very closely with the Program Chairs, to coordinate the amount of time in the program available for demos, the meeting space, and the demo descriptions for the conference proceedings.
