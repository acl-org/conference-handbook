## Overview of Responsibilities

The Tutorial Chair at *CL conferences is responsible for requesting tutorial proposals and making final selections. When appropriate, the tutorial chair can recruit a small committee to help evaluate the proposals and make final decisions. In years when more than one person co-chair, this might not be necessary.

**The following are the main responsibilities of the Tutorial Chairs:**

**1. Cross-Committee Coordination.**\
**2. Tutorial Proposal Submission & Review**\
**3. Tutorial Notifications & Logistics**

## Breakdown of Responsibilities

### 1. Cross-Committee Coordination

This responsibility concerns liaising with previous chairs to gather important details that help the planning of tutorials, in addition to scheduling tutorials alongside other conferences.

In recent years, the selection of tutorials has been made in unison with other conferences such as NAACL, EACL, AACL, EMNLP, etc. as appropriate. This helps ensure a variety of topics across conference locations and creates a more diverse pool for submissions. However, the conference-specific tutorial chair will need to coordinate with the local chair to understand room availability (e.g., how many tutorials are there room for).

| Coordinate with Other Conferences (e.g., EACL, AACL, NAACL, EMNLP, ACL) | Nov  2024 | Nov  2024 | -          | Where possible, try to allocate tutorials across conferences that avoid repetition and allow a range of activities throughout the conference calendar year. |

### 2.  Tutorial Proposal Submission & Review
Appropriate submission and review deadlines on all tutorials should be allocated (in conjunction with their general chair).

The following criteria should be considered when deciding what tutorials to accept:
* Cutting Edge Topics in CL/NLP
* Introductory Content in CL/NLP (e.g., linguistics, bioinformatics, machine learning techniques, HCI, etc.)
* Diversity & Inclusion - Emphasis should be given to tutorials from underrepresented groups and topics that promote diversity (e.g., minority language groups), participation diversity (e.g., coordination with affinity groups), and representation diversity (i.e., among the tutorial instructors themselves). Consider contacting the Diversity & Inclusion chairs on this topics.

Consequently, tutorial proposals must contain the following information:
* Title, authors, affiliations, and contact details.
* Brief TLDR description of tutorial content and relevance to CL/NLP.
* Tutorial type (i.e., cutting edge or introductory).
* Target audience and prerequisites (i.e., math, linguistics, machine learning, and programming requirements).
* Outline of tutorial structure and content across the 3 hour slot (excl. coffee breaks). Some 6-hour tutorials may be possible.
* Explanation of the work/research to be discussed (i.e., it should not just be work from the tutorial instructors).
* Recommended reading list
* Research overview and teaching experience for each proposed tutorial instructor.
* Esimated turorial attendance.
* Preferred venue.
* Technical equipment requirements.
* Agreement to open-source tutorial resources or justification as to why not.
* Ethics statement pertaining to implications of the tutorial.
* (Optional) Pedagogical material to aid attendees to further disseminate the learned content.

### 3.  Tutorial Notifications & Logistics 

Tutorial chairs who are responsible for collecting one page tutorial abstracts and materials for the proceedings. Tutorial submissions often vary greatly in depth, concreteness, and thoroughness, so the tutorial chair should make expectations (both what is required and when it is required) clear upon acceptance to give the tutorial authors enough time to respond to requests.

**Up to 3 instructors of each tutorial are eligible for fee waivers for the main conference and a subset of co-located tutorials and workshops.**
