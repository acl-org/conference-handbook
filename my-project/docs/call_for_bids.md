Call for Bids to Host ACL-20

```
58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics

The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) hereby invites proposals to host the conference in the America region in July or August 2020. At this time, we seek preliminary draft proposals from prospective bidders in the relevant regions. Promising bidders will be asked to provide additional information for the final selection.

ACL 2020 will be organized in collaboration with NAACL as usual. The ACL 2020 Coordinating Committee, made up of representatives of the ACL and representatives from the NAACL, will select the General Chair and the Program Committee Co-Chairs for the conference. Draft proposals should identify Local Arrangements Chair(s), who will work with the General Chair and the Coordinating Committee to develop a detailed plan and budget.

To facilitate conference organization, bidders may delegate many tasks of their choice to a Professional Conference Organizer and/or to the ACL Office (Priscilla Rasmussen). Bid guidelines, including expense and task list templates and additional useful links are provided at:
