# Conference Handbook

This handbook provides information on the organization of *ACL conferences* (including ACL, EACL, NAACL-HLT, AACL, and EMNLP), while it is also partially applicable to other ACL-related events (e.g. workshops).

A large part of this handbook is borrowed from the [old version of the conference handbook](https://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/Conference_Handbook), and significantly reorganized and updated to follow the latest information of ACL conferences.

The ACL conference officer is mainly responsible for maintaining this handbook, while contributions from conference chairs/organizers are necessary.
The source of the handbook is put in the [github repository](https://github.com/acl-org/conference-handbook).
Conference chairs/organizers should send pull requests for updating the contents of each document.
