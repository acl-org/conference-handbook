# Student Research Workshop

The Student Research Workshop is organized by the student chairs, with guidance from the faculty advisors appointed by the General Chair.

## Student Chairs

The student chairs of the Student Research Workshop are responsible for assembling the program committee, requesting student papers, selecting appropriate ones, arranging for their presentation (including the format, such as oral or posters, and if appropriate refreshments, presentation and computer requirements, and all other special needs).
In addition, the student chairs are responsible for proposing travel grant recipients --- see [policy on general student travel funding](https://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/Student_travel_funding).
This may include proposing funding allocations for student applicants for the full conference, not only for SRW participants -- the student chairs should coordinate with the general chair and the ACL Office about this.

If the selected student papers are presented in a workshop, then the same general instructions apply as those that hold for workshop chairs (see [Workshop Chairs](workshop.md)).

The workshops must be self-financing (at least); any surplus belong to ACL, but may (with agreement by the Exec) be used to support invited speakers and students.

See the [SRW policies page](https://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/***_student_session_policies#Roles_and_Responsibilites_of_the_Organising_Committee) for more information about the goals and policies of the SRW (though the page has not been updated for some time).

## Faculty Advisors

The faculty advisors are responsible for:

- overseeing the organization of the SRW and providing suggestions to the student chairs
- ensuring that [ACL student session policies](https://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/***_student_session_policies) are adhered to seeking funding for students to attend the ACL conference and in particular the ACL Student Research Workshop
- overseeing the selection of students to receive travel funding (see [ACL policy on general student travel funding](https://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/Student_travel_funding))

The faculty advisors are responsible for submitting proposals for funding to external funding agencies.
[ACL-05 proposal to NSF](https://www.aclweb.org/archive/policies/current/student-funding-proposal-05.pdf) provides a sample proposal.
However, efforts should be extended to funding agencies in Europe and Asia, since NSF restrictions can limit the travel funds that can be provided to students based outside the United States.
The faculty advisors should begin seeking funding immediately upon appointment to the position.

## SRW Program Committee

The student chairs, in collaboration with the faculty advisors, assemble a list of reviewers.
The student chairs invite the reviewers to serve on the SRW program committee.

## Call for Papers

Sample calls for student papers appear in [CFP for student research workshop at ACL-17](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-2017-student-research-workshop-srw).

## Mentoring

If the student chairs and the faculty advisors decide on a mentorship program for student papers, the student chairs recruit mentors (first among the program committee) and assign them student mentees.

Mentorship can take the form of pre-submission mentorship, to give feedback on the quality of writing and presentation prior to submission, and/or post-acceptance mentorship, to provide feedback to students in the form of in-depth comments and questions during the conference.

## Travel Grant Recommendation

If funds are available to support student travel, the student chairs, in collaboration with the faculty advisors, gather requests for funding from students and make recommendations for funding allocation, to be approved by the ACL Treasurer.

## Proceedings

Proceedings are printed and distributed by the ACL.
Deadlines and instructions are given by the publication chair.
