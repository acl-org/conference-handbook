# Call for Bids

This page describes the process for issuing call for conference bids and to select the final bid.

## Procedure

The Exec's nominee (currently, the VP) makes a general call for bids to the international community. He or she collects the responses and presents them to the Exec. Final selection usually involves a site visit by members of the Exec to the location(s) of interest; usually, the treasurer and the ACL business manager travel for the site visit.
