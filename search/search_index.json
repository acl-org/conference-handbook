This handbook describes implementation of the selection process. Nominations In the review process, reviewers (Note: PCs may choose whether or not to include reviewers in the nomination process.), AEs, ACs, and SACs will be asked to answer the following questions: \"Could the camera-ready version of this paper merit consideration for an \"outstanding paper\" award (up to 2.5% of accepted papers will be recognized in this way)? Outstanding papers should be either fascinating, controversial, surprising, impressive, or potentially field-changing. Awards will be decided based on the camera-ready version of the paper.\" \"Yes\" \"Maybe\" \"No\" \"If yes/maybe, please briefly describe why:\" (short answer box with no word or character limit) The best paper committee should consider any paper that was marked \"Yes\" or \"Maybe\" by any reviewer (Note: PCs may choose whether or not consider papers that were labeled 'maybe' by a reviewer and not nominated by the AE/AC.), AE, AC, or SAC (Note: This requirement is included to clarify how this policy interacts with ACL Rolling Review.). SACs may also choose a paper in their area to receive the \"Area Chair's Award\". This will encourage diversity in the papers that are highlighted. SACs may not give this award to a paper that one of the SACs in the track has a conflict-of-interest (COI) on, but any other paper in their track can be chosen. Papers that SACs have COIs on can be nominated for other awards. If a conference has a COI track, that track does not select an Area Chair's award. The process for SACs to choose the award is up to the SACs (e.g., whether and how to involve ACs). The Best Paper Committee will not be told which papers have received this award, to avoid biasing their choices. Papers are not eligible for awards if their authors include Program Chairs. The PCs may also choose to specify that authors in other senior organisational roles are not eligible for awards. Special category awards can either be handled in the same way, by editing the question above to include them, or through a separate process defined by the PCs. The eligibility for non-publicized paper awards should be confirmed before notification, i.e., in-between the final acceptance decision by PCs and notification. The best paper committee chairs or program chairs search for paper titles and authors of the candidates at preprint servers, popular social media, or on the web in general. Organization of Best Paper Committee Program chairs should select and appoint a Best Paper Committee Chair(s) early in the process (it is recommended well before the submission deadline), who will manage the entire process. A best paper committee will be selected by the program chairs together with the Best Paper Committee Chair(s). The committee size should be large enough to keep the load to around 10-15 papers per member. The committee should be diverse in composition in terms of research areas and demographics. It is best to form the committee before the review process commences, otherwise it may be hard to recruit members. Collection of Publicized Status and Anonymized PDFs The program chairs should collect (1) publicized/non-publicized status and (2) anonymized versions of PDFs at the time of camera-ready submission. Both are critical for the award selection process. The simplest way should be to use the camera-ready submission form and ask everyone to submit these. If this process turns out to be difficult for some reason and the papers are not anonymized, then the committee chair is encouraged to manually redact author information on the first page of the paper. Selection Process The process below was developed based on the assumption that the nomination process leads to 50-80 papers being considered for awards. If the number of nominated papers turns out to be much higher, this process will not scale. Best paper award chairs have latitude and discretion for the design of the selection process. PCs should approve the process. The committee will follow a multistage process to determine the final awards. The committee will receive the (anonymized) camera-ready version of the paper, anonymized reviews, and associated supplementary materials. If the papers are not anonymized then the committee chair is encouraged to redact author information on the first page of the paper. Also, the chair should encourage the committee to not look for revealing author information elsewhere (e.g. acceptance list on the conference page). 1. Papers are divided between the committee members based on research areas for a first pass in which each paper is read by at least 2 committee members. They independently place the papers into three groups: (1) consider for best paper, (2) consider for outstanding paper, (3) do not consider further. 2. All committee members read the papers that both readers placed under consideration for 'best paper'. 3. The committee meets to make the final selections. This proposal does not define a specific rubric. However, while reading and discussing papers, committee members should consider: Is each paper either fascinating, controversial, surprising, impressive, or potentially field-changing? Note that papers do not need to demonstrate all of these properties; any property is sufficient. Does the paper present as its motivating use case an application with significant negative social impact? Even if the motivating use case is an application with neutral or positive social impact, are there obvious applications with significant negative social impact which are left unaddressed or insufficiently addressed by the paper? (In such cases, the paper should not be an award candidate.) Is the work presented in the paper reproducible? For example, is there sufficient information in the paper to repeat the experiments? If not, is the lack of reproducibility justified in the paper? Do the awards highlight a broad range of research types and strengths? Do the awards include types of research that can be conducted at small labs? Do the awards include papers that show excellence in potential positive social impact? Special awards may be selected by the best paper committee or by separate committees. All award decisions may be overruled by the PCs.","title":"Best Paper Award Chair"},{"location":"award/#best-paper-award-chair","text":"Best Paper Award Chairs are responsible for selecting conference awards complying with the ACL Conference Awards Policy .

It is the General Chair's prerogative to appoint chairs, subject to confirmation by the ACL Executive Board, and assign tasks to them. (This does not include the Program Chairs or Local Organization Chairs, who are appointed by the ACL Executive Board.) The chairs that must be appointed include: Tutorial Chairs, Workshop Chairs, Student Research Workshop Chairs (and Faculty Advisors to the Student Research Workshop), Demo Chairs, Publications Chairs, Publicity Chair, Handbook Chair, and Sponsorship Chair. The General Chair has the following responsibilities: Identify conference tasks and people responsible for them. This includes selecting chairs for workshops, tutorials, demos, student research workshop, publications, publicity, and the handbook. Ideally, the workshop, tutorial, and demo chair teams are teams of two persons, where experience, gender, seniority may be mixed. The Student Research Workshop and Publications Chair teams should ideally contain three or more people. The Publicity and Handbook Chair could be individuals, who work closely with the Local and Publication Chairs. Candidates should be gathered in consultation with the ACL Exec before they are formally contacted. Build a specific timetable for each chair (team), based on the timetable , for the dates of the current conference. Make a site visit to the conference site to approve and finalize local arrangements, preferably together with the ACL Treasurer and ACL Office. Work with the Local Arrangements Chair to establish registration fees. Work with the Program Chairs to create the main conference structure (i.e., parallel tracks, workshop and tutorial scheduling, etc.) Later, work with the Program Chairs to construct a conference program (balancing oral and poster presentations, invited talks, business meeting, etc.).

Other portions are the result of discussions following recent conferences. Program Committee: ACL has a four-tiered program committee structure: the Program Committee Co-chairs (PC Chairs), the senior area chairs (SAC), the area chairs or senior PC members (AC), and the regular members of the program committee (reviewers). SACs and ACs are selected by PC Chairs. ACL policy prohibits the ACL exec members from serving as ACs (including SACs); for joint conferences with a local chapter, the same restriction applies to members of that chapter's Executive Board. In selecting ACs, consideration should be given to prior experience as a reviewer, having new people as ACs, coverage of the areas of anticipated submissions, and geographical and gender distribution. ACs should be informed of their responsibilites (including the selection of the recipient of the Best Paper Award) at the time they are invited to serve as ACs. Area Chairs can cover more than one area and can overlap areas. In the Call for Papers, some past PC Chairs have preferred not to list the specific areas of ACs in order to avoid biasing the submissions. ACs select reviewers, in consultation with PC Chairs. Consideration should be given to having a balance of experienced and new members of the program committee and geotraphical and gender distribution. The conference proceedings should list PC Chairs, SACs, ACs, reviewers, and any additional reviewers who contributed to reviewing papers, using the headings \"Program Committee Co-Chairs\", \"Senior Area Chairs\", \"Area Chairs\" or \"Senior PC Members\", \"Program Committee Members\", and \"Additional Reviewers\". The names and affiliations for PC Chairs, SACs, and ACs should be given in the proceedings. For reviewers and additional reviewers, only the name is given. All lists should be compiled in alphabetical order. Each reviewer is in charge of the review of 5-10 papers, whereas an additional reviewer reviews at most 2 papers. In the unlikely event that an additional reviewer is asked to review 5 or more papers he or she may, at the discretion of PC Chairs, be upgraded to the status of a regular reviewer. This upgrading process must be triggered by the reviewer who allocated so many papers to a single additional reviewer, by a suitable suggestion to PC Chairs. Regular reviewers may recruit additional reviewers, but the responsibility to get adequate reviews for the allocated papers remains with the regular reviewers. The reviewers report to ACs, and they in turn report to PC Chairs. Additional reviewers report to the reviewer who recruited them. Use of the START conference software: For the past years, ACL has used the START conference software for paper submission, reviewing, and helping with the publication process. PC Chairs should consult with the General Chair and the Executive Committee about whether a contract with START currently exists or whether a new contract should be negotiated. This needs to be settled very early, so that the conference software will be available for submissions. Relevance of papers to ACL: In recent years, a broader range of papers have been solicited for ACL conferences, including papers in information retrieval, spoken language recognition and understanding, tools and language resources, and applications. ACL wants to continue to encourage papers in all areas related to language processing. The authors have the burden of explaining a paper's relevance to the CL community. Mentoring service: ACL conferences provide a mentoring service to help authors, from countries where English is not the language of scientific exchange, produce a fluent paper. PC Chairs are responsible for setting up the mentoring service for the conference. The mentoring service typically is chaired by an individual who is not an AC. The Chair of the mentoring service identifies a set of mentors. Papers are sent to the Chair of the mentoring service some weeks prior to the conference submission deadline, and the mentors work with the authors to improve the communication of their research. The mentoring service should be announced in the Call for Papers and publicized on the conference web site, etc. Paper submission deadline: Every year, PC Chairs receive several papers that arrive after the deadline. Although there have been variations in how such papers are handled, the majority opinion is that the deadline should be strictly enforced in the interest of fairness to those authors who could have improved their papers if they had extra time. The policy on late submissions should be explicitly stated and well-publicized. It is important that the precise time zone for the deadline be clearly stated, such as 5pm Eastern Standard Time. Double blind reviewing: ACL requires that papers be blind reviewed. Consequently, clear instructions must be provided about omitting references that will disclose the author's identify. PC Chairs must decide how to handle papers that violate author anonymity for blind reviewing. In recent years, such papers have been returned to the authors without review. Length/format restrictions on papers: Length restrictions should be stated in terms of font size, margin size, page size, and number of pages. The provision of style files makes it easy for the authors to adhere to these guidelines. PC Chairs should communicate with publication chairs to determine the detailed format restrictions and the style files. PC Chairs must decide how to handle papers that violate the length restrictions on submissions. It is generally felt that length restrictions must be adhered to, and that papers that violate these restrictions should not be reviewed; the basis for this view is that most authors would have liked extra pages to explain their work, but have worked hard to cut their papers down to the requisite length. Thus reviewing papers that violate the length restrictions gives an advantage to the authors of those papers. Double submission policy: Papers presented at an ACL conference must represent new work that has not been previously published. It is the responsiblity of the author to inform the program chair of any potential problem with respect to this requirement, as noted in the following guidelines. Papers that have appeared at a conference with published (archival) proceedings constitute previously published work. Papers that overlap other papers that have appeared at a conference with published (archival) proceedings must contain significant new results. Authors must include on the title page a list of any previous papers that the current paper overlaps or extends, and must identify the significant new results contained in the new submission. PC Chairs have the final decision about what constitutes significant new results. Papers that have appeared at a (non-archival) workshop do not constitute previously published work, as long as the paper submitted to ACL is an extension of the workshop paper. Extensions might include new results, more in-depth analysis, evaluation that was not part of the workshop paper, or further experiments. Authors must include on the title page a list of any previous workshop papers that the current paper extends, and must identify how the current submission extends the previous workshop papers. The program co-chairs have the final decision about whether the ACL submission represents an extension of the workshop papers. Papers being submitted both to ACL and another conference or workshop must note this in submission. (This includes submissions that are extensions of papers currently being submitted to a workshop.) A paper to be presented at ACL must be withdrawn from other conferences and workshops. For details, refer to ACL Policies for Submission, Review and Citation . Authors are expected to adhere to the ACL policy on double submission of papers. However, double submissions that do not follow this policy have been problematic at recent conferences. For ACL-05, the program chairs consulted with the program chairs of other major conferences (such as IJCAI) to determine when authors had submitted to multiple conferences. The submissions were checked, and papers that were multiply submitted (ie., not substantially different) and accepted by more than one conference were rejected from one or both of the conferences. Paper reviewing and acceptance: ACL Policy on Conflicts of Interest: ACL has adopted a formal conflict-of-interest policy . It is essential that PC Chairs, SACs, ACs, and reviewers be familiar with the policy. Submissions by PC Chairs or their students pose special problems. Although there is not an ACL policy prohibiting PC Chairs from submitting to the ACL conference for which they are serving as PC Chairs, PC Chairs and their students are encouraged to submit papers to a different conference to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest in the paper acceptance process. Review forms from recent conferences are available. Although the content of the review form is at the discretion of PC Chairs, the ACL executive committee suggests the following in order to provide a good evaluation of application and tools papers: \"Does this paper provide data, software, or source code that will be useful to other researchers in this area?\" \"How useful to the community are any resources released along with the paper.\" PC Chairs and SACs/ACs are responsible for ensuring a high quality technical program. Since the quality of submissions is not uniform from year to year, the acceptance rate for papers may vary from one ACL conference to another. As a guide, an acceptance rate below 20% would be unusually low and an acceptance rate of 30% would be unusually high; however, it is the perogative of PC Chairs to evaluate the quality of the submissions and, in consultation with the General Chair, to determine what is an appropriate acceptance rate for the particular conference. Best Paper Award: The PC Chairs and SACs/ACs are responsible for selecting the recipient of the ACL Best Paper Award and other awards. The Best Paper Award is presented to the recipient, along with a framed award certificate, at the conference. The award selection process should follow the ACL conference awards policy . Visas: To address the visa problem, PC Chairs should notify the authors of submitted papers that if a visa will be needed to attend the conference, authors should do the following: set up an appointment with the appropriate consulate for shortly after the acceptance notification date, and contact the ACL Office for a letter of invitation when the paper is accepted. Documents More documents, including email templates, instructions to SACs/ACs/reviewers, managing START, etc. will be added.

In the unusual circumstances where none of the authors could make it to the conference due to visa issues or illness, an acceptable common practice has been for the authors to arrange a designated speaker who can deliver the talk on behalf of the authors. However, there have been increasing recent concerns regarding traveling bans (e.g., the US government in 2017 tried to impose a traveling ban on Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen), which will likely impact many valuable members of our conferences. Thus, ACL recommends that conference organizers of all ACL endorsed conferences facilitate technical support for participants to present their work and engage with the audience remotely. The exact details on how to arrange technical support will vary depending on the available resources at different conference venues. This article serves as a general guideline. Remote presentation chair : It is recommended that the conference organizers appoint a chair who will be in charge of facilitating remote presentations. The responsibilities of the remote presentation chair include (1) setting up the web applications, (2) reviewing the applications, (3) collecting recorded talks by a predetermined deadline, and (4) coordinating with the A/V support and the session chairs in advance for sessions that include remote presentations. Recorded talks and live QA sessions : It is recommended that the authors prepare a recorded talk by a deadline proposed by the local chairs. The recorded video will be used for the main presentation since real time streaming may not be reliable. The QA session should be streamed live to maintain the interactiveness of the conference talks. Application process : The authors will apply for remote presentation (for each paper separately) via a web application form submitted to the conference organizers by a deadline determined by the conference. To maintain the interactive nature of the conference, conference organizers may consider placing an upper bound on the total number of remote presentations allowed. The upper bound should not be too restrictive, keeping in mind the need to support authors who are struggling with major challenges such as visa restrictions, death in immediate family, major health issues, mobility issues, or other serious issues that impede traveling. At the same time, organizers should carefully examine the applications to allow remote presentations only when there is a compelling reason in order to maintain the interactive nature of the conferences. Another viable alternative to keep in mind, which has been the common practice in most previous conferences, is for the authors to send a speaker who is well aware of the work and can present the talk on behalf of the authors. Especially if the speaker can handle the QA session on behalf of the authors, this may be the preferred option over recorded talks. Yet another alternative that combines the strength of the remote presentation with a substitute speaker is to arrange a speaker who can give the talk on behalf of the authors, followed by an interactive QA session via live stream with the original authors. Selecting presentation modes (oral vs. poster) : The conference organizers will consult with local organizers to determine the viable options with respect to remote oral presentations vs. remote poster presentations. It is recommended that the organizers will consider different preparation requirements for each presentation mode as described below. Supporting remote oral presentations : The technical crews and the session chair allocated for each session will need to be in charge of initiating the playback of the recorded talk and managing the live QA session. Supporting remote poster presentations : The conference organizers will need to allocate support personnel with an appropriate computer for each poster who can be in charge of the playback of the recorded talk and the live QA session. Because poster presentations tend to be more interactive by nature, a potential concern with remote poster presentation is that conference audiences may not find this mode of presentation appealing enough --- especially watching a pre-recorded video on a small screen before initiating a live conversation --- to engage with the remote presenters. Therefore, many participants might engage directly with the presenters via live QA without watching the pre-recorded talks. Due to the potential disruption with the internet connection, however, it is recommended that the presenters prepare recorded talks. Registration cost : The participants giving talks remotely will be required to register for the conference at a reduced cost. The exact amount will be determined by the ACL office and the Treasurer (including chapter Treasurer if applicable), based on data and information provided by the conference organizers. It is estimated that approximately 50% of the charge may be reasonable to share the required charge for reserving the conference venue and technical support. The discounted rate will be applicable only to conference registration. The ACL membership fee will remain identical for all participants. Guidelines for local chairs : The local chairs will work with the venue to probe the available internet speed and the viability of live streaming during the QA sessions. It is important to keep in mind that even if the venue offers high speed internet connection, the streaming can be unreliable if the internet is unstable else where, for example, at the remote presenter's end.","title":"Guidelines on Remote Conference Presentation"},{"location":"remote/#guidelines-on-remote-conference-presentation","text":"ACL conferences have been requiring at least one of the authors to be present at the conference and give a talk in order for their paper to appear in the proceedings.

The recorded video will be used for the main presentation since real time streaming may not be reliable. The QA session should be streamed live to maintain the interactiveness of the conference talks. Application process : The authors will apply for remote presentation (for each paper separately) via a web application form submitted to the conference organizers by a deadline determined by the conference. To maintain the interactive nature of the conference, conference organizers may consider placing an upper bound on the total number of remote presentations allowed. The upper bound should not be too restrictive, keeping in mind the need to support authors who are struggling with major challenges such as visa restrictions, death in immediate family, major health issues, mobility issues, or other serious issues that impede traveling. At the same time, organizers should carefully examine the applications to allow remote presentations only when there is a compelling reason in order to maintain the interactive nature of the conferences. Another viable alternative to keep in mind, which has been the common practice in most previous conferences, is for the authors to send a speaker who is well aware of the work and can present the talk on behalf of the authors. Especially if the speaker can handle the QA session on behalf of the authors, this may be the preferred option over recorded talks. Yet another alternative that combines the strength of the remote presentation with a substitute speaker is to arrange a speaker who can give the talk on behalf of the authors, followed by an interactive QA session via live stream with the original authors. Selecting presentation modes (oral vs. poster) : The conference organizers will consult with local organizers to determine the viable options with respect to remote oral presentations vs. remote poster presentations. It is recommended that the organizers will consider different preparation requirements for each presentation mode as described below. Supporting remote oral presentations : The technical crews and the session chair allocated for each session will need to be in charge of initiating the playback of the recorded talk and managing the live QA session. Supporting remote poster presentations : The conference organizers will need to allocate support personnel with an appropriate computer for each poster who can be in charge of the playback of the recorded talk and the live QA session. Because poster presentations tend to be more interactive by nature, a potential concern with remote poster presentation is that conference audiences may not find this mode of presentation appealing enough --- especially watching a pre-recorded video on a small screen before initiating a live conversation --- to engage with the remote presenters. Therefore, many participants might engage directly with the presenters via live QA without watching the pre-recorded talks. Due to the potential disruption with the internet connection, however, it is recommended that the presenters prepare recorded talks. Registration cost : The participants giving talks remotely will be required to register for the conference at a reduced cost. The exact amount will be determined by the ACL office and the Treasurer (including chapter Treasurer if applicable), based on data and information provided by the conference organizers. It is estimated that approximately 50% of the charge may be reasonable to share the required charge for reserving the conference venue and technical support. The discounted rate will be applicable only to conference registration. The ACL membership fee will remain identical for all participants. Guidelines for local chairs : The local chairs will work with the venue to probe the available internet speed and the viability of live streaming during the QA sessions. It is important to keep in mind that even if the venue offers high speed internet connection, the streaming can be unreliable if the internet is unstable else where, for example, at the remote presenter's end.","title":"Guidelines on Remote Conference Presentation"},{"location":"schedule/","text":"Conference schedule Generic timetable The generic timetable for organizing the conference, from which a specific one can be built (months in advance from conference).

Additionally, they must address special requests, such as wheelchair rentals and sign language interpretation, and collaborate with the local chairs to ensure these needs are met. The following are the main responsibilities of the D&I Chairs: 1. D&I Sponsorship and Cross-Committee Coordination \\ 2. D&I Registration Subsidy Allocation \\ 3. Activity Management (Birds of a Feather and Affinity Groups) \\ 4. Help with Accessibility and Special Accommodations \\ 5. (Optional) Organize Lunch with ACL Fellows An excellent additional resource for D&I chairs is this guide compiled by Sabine Weber. Breakdown of Responsibilities 1. D&I Sponsorship and Cross-Committee Coordination This responsibility focuses on acquiring necessary funding for D&I related activities, in addition to receiving clarifications and advice from previous D&I chairs. Task Start Deadline Dependency Notes Contact previous *CL D&I Chairs ASAP July 2025 - - Advertise Funding for D&I in Sponsorship Booklet Nov 2024 Nov 2024 - Collaborate with NAACL D&I and sponsorship chairs. D&I requires funding to fund its subsidies and other activities. This is to attract funding from companies who apply for this specific type of sponsorship. Network with Potential D&I Sponsors Dec 2024 June 2025 - - 2. D&I Registration Subsidy Allocation D&I subsidies consist of registration, caregiving, bandwidth, travel, and VPN subsidies. ACL strongly encourages researchers from developing countries and marginalized communities, students, and researchers with financial hurdles to apply for both D&I subsidies and volunteering opportunities to maximize their chances of waiving their registration fees. Virtual Registration Subsidy Note: Discounted virtual registration may be offered to low-income virtual attendees, and this is funded by ACL rather than the D&I budget. There are the following exceptions: (1) Authors with accepted papers, (2) Employed/funded individuals/students from: the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and higher-income countries in Asia and the Middle East. The timeline approximately follows that shown below. However, there is no funding cap (pending approval from the ACL Executive Committee) - chairs should determine the level of subsidy for Virtual registration on a per-applicant basis (inc. whether or not to waive the ACL membership fee). Further, these subsidies may be offered in some cases to presenting authors who did not receive a standard D&I subsidy or have other extenuating circumstances. We recommend connecting with the ACL Equity Director before releasing the Call for Virtual Registration Subsidies to ensure alignment on application questions and selection criteria. Task Start Deadline Dependency Notes Create Calls for D&I Subsidies Jan 2025 Apr 2025 - (1) Contact the ACL Business Team and/or past D&I Committees for an application form template. Avoid using Google Forms to ensure accessibility to participants in China. (2) Forms must make clear what is to be covered by the D&I subsidies. (3) Example Calls: Virtual , In-Person . Publicize Calls for D&I Subsides - May 2025 - Coordinate with Publicity and Website Chairs to post and share Call. Include application deadline and notification timeline. Example D&I Social Media Blurbs . Collect Applications for D&I Subsidies May 2025 June 2025 Call must be public (1) Collect the following from applicants: Personal details, paper information, first-time attendance status, student status, financial situation and visa requirements. (2) Forms must make clear what is to be covered by the D&I subsidies. Establish D&I Subsidy Policy Mat 2025 June 2025 - (1) Coordinate with ACL Business Team to identify available subsidies (ACL/Sponsors), set up a budget tracker spreadsheet, and set up registration discount codes. (2) Determine allocation basis (partial support to many applicants vs. full support to fewer, or somewhere in between). Draft List of Awardees June 2025 June 2025 - (1) Tackle virtual attendees first (these require approval from ACL Execs, which may take several days). (2) Prioritize first-time attendees, underrepresented groups, non-high-income regions and those that have not received this funding before/recently. (3) Estimate subsidy costs based on the geographical location and status of the proposed awardees. (4) Contact the Student Volunteer Chairs to identify whether potential awardees have also been granted a student volunteer position. (5) Before notification, the recommended standard D&I subsidy awardee list must be shared with the ACL Business Team for approval, while the virtual registration awardee list must be shared with the ACL Equity Director for approval by the Executive Committee. Send Notifications to Awardees -- June 2025 Finalized award list (1) Notifications must be sent before Early Bird registration deadline, as all registration waivers expire after it. (2) Notifications must clearly state the award details and reimbursement cap. (3) Three types of notifications should be sent: A rejection letter for applicants who were not awarded subsidies, an acceptance letter for those who do not require pre-paid accommodation, and an acceptance letter for those who do require pre-paid accommodation (which should request scanned Passport photos to allow hotel bookings; note that this is difficult to coordinate, and most recent conferences instead reimbursed accommodation costs). (4) Deadlines should be presented to awardees to accept subsidies in order for rejected subsidies to be reallocated. You may consider putting some applicants on a waitlist instead of rejecting them to account for this possibility. (5) Notification Templates . 3. Activity Management (Birds of a Feather and Affinity Groups) This responsibility focuses on the creation of activities with shared research and non-research interests, allowing attendees to discuss ideas and network with likeminded individuals. This helps create a more welcoming environment at the conference, especially for student and first-time attendees. Task Start Deadline Dependency Notes Create Call for Birds of a Feather and Affinity Group Events Feb 2025 Mar 2025 - Example Birds of a Feather/Affinity Call. Publicize Call for Birds of a Feather and Affinity Group Events Apr 2025 Apr 2025 Room availability confirmed Application deadline: Late May 2025. Coordinate with Publicity and Website Chairs to post and share Call. We recommend publicizing through ACL and Corpora mailing lists, ACL social media, and direct contact with affinity groups and the ACL Mentorship Team . Review Applications for Birds of a Feather and Affinity Groups May 2025 June 2025 Closed applications Coordinate with Organizers and Business team to confirm the amount of available time slots for these sessions, and ensure that an appropriate number of sessions are accepted. You can consider merging sessions that are highly related to each other. Some session organizers may prefer to hold their event over a lunch break; be sure to confirm expectations about scheduling and catering ahead of time. Send Notifications to Accepted Birds of a Feather and Affinity Groups June 2025 June 2025 - Inform the Organizers and Business team to ensure inclusion in the conference program. Coordinate with them and session organizers to find an appropriate time for their event on the schedule (i.e., which doesn't conflict with related poster, oral, or panel sessions). 4. Help with Accessibility and Special Accommodations This responsibility focuses on ensuring that the conference meets the accessibility requirements of its attendees, including the elicitation of attendee needs and the allocation of rooms. Task Start Deadline Dependency Notes Confirm Venue Accommodations Jan 2025 July 2025 - Wheelchair accessibility, gender-neutral bathrooms, prayer rooms, etc. Plan D&I Room Allocation April 2025 May 2025 Main conference room allocation details from Business Team & finalized list of D&I events Children's room, quiet room, prayer rooms, Affinity event rooms, etc. Finalize D&I Registration Form Questions Apr 2025 Before registration opens - Collaborate with Megs Haddad & Jenn Rachford to ensure alignment on questions in the registration form. Be careful with word choices to avoid unintended promises (e.g., the word \"accommodation\" can be interpreted as related to hotels). Collect Accommodation & Mentoring Requests in Registration Forms After registration opens July 2025 Registration open (1) Collaborate with Megs Haddad & Jenn Rachford. (2) Send mentoring requests to ACL Mentorship team. (3) Connect with those who request accommodations to introduce yourself and confirm their specific needs. Organize Closed Captioning After registration opens Before conference begins The registration form will ask attendees whether they require closed captioning. If closed captioning is requested by attendees, we have a legal obligation to provide it for their sessions of choice (usually the plenary sessions are sufficient, but we recommend reaching out to these attendees for more information about their needs). This cost is typically covered by the D&I Budget, so be sure to account for this in awarding D&I Subsidies. Additional notes/lessons learned: Bringing Children to the Conference: At some past conferences, children were not allowed at the venue without a registration badge, which is disappointing and unexpected for many attendees. Raise the question of children\u2019s access to the venue and receptions with the ACL team (Jenn Rachford), the PC chairs, and the venue well in advance . Children\u2019s access policies need to be clearly stated in the registration form and on the website: what rooms will children be allowed in? What kind of registration will they need (if any), and what kind of registration is needed for a family member/partner who is caring for a small child? If a registration fee is needed to give children and accompanying family members access to the venue, the D&I team can consider offering childcare subsidies for this. Closed Captioning: If closed captioning is provided, make sure attendees will know how to access captions (if they can\u2019t be shown live onscreen). Underline should be able to share QR codes before plenary sessions for this, but be sure to ask ahead of time. D&I Room Allocation: Make sure the D&I-related rooms are clearly and visibly promoted at the venue. The venue will likely have various screens to direct people, and the information for these may be sent weeks in advance (contact ACL Business Team to ask them to include D&I rooms in this). Room locations can also be announced on Whova for more visibility. Check that the physical signage and the online announcements explain each room\u2019s purpose clearly (e.g., that the quiet room serves as a break space for attendees with sensory issues and is not for working). Dietary restrictions: Work with the venue to ensure food for attendees with dietary restrictions (e.g., Halal) is clearly labeled. Find out which food labels suit each dietary requirement (e.g., vegetarian dishes were also Halal at Austria Center Vienna). Don\u2019t print dietary restrictions on name badges: some labels (e.g., Halal) may indicate the participant\u2019s religion, which they may not want to publicly disclose. Registration Form Questions: The \u201cmentoring\u201d questions on the registration form (\u201cDo you have any interest in being a mentor/being mentored?\u201d) are typically not followed up on. At ACL 2025, we forwarded the responses to the ACL year-round mentoring team (who used them to promote a mentoring event at ACL 2025). Still, nothing is being done to match mentors and mentees. We recommend either: Changing the question to a more generic one, like \u201care you interested in mentoring events at the conference?\u201d, or Starting a matching process for mentors and mentees. It might help to make the questions a bit clearer; this isn\u2019t a long-term, formal mentoring relationship, but simply a \u201cbuddy system\u201d that pairs new conference attendees with experienced conference attendees. 5. (Optional) Organize Lunch with ACL Fellows Introduced at EMNLP 2024, this optional activity allows D&I awardees to meet with ACL Fellows for networking that they may otherwise not be able to access. This should be funded by the D&I budget, and can be a great way to spend unused budget (e.g., if any D&I Subsidy awardees failed to secure a visa or dropped out at the last minute). Task Start Deadline Dependency Notes Ascertain Interest TBD July 2025 - Send out a form asking D&I subsidy awardees and ACL Fellows if they are interested in attending such an activity and identify topic interests. Group Awardees & Fellows July 2025 July 2025 Identify interested individuals. Group D&I subsidy awardees and ACL Fellows based on shared interests. Lunch July 2025 July 2025 - (1) Book a restaurant (near the venue) and send instructions on when/where to meet.

Overview of Responsibilities The Student Session provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of computational linguists to enter the CL community. It allows the best students in the field to take their first important step towards becoming professional computational linguists by: Receiving critical feedback on their work from experts outside their advisory team; Making contact with other students and key researchers in their field; Presenting their work formally in a professional setting; Reviewing the work of others and assisting in the organisation of the session. The following are the main responsibilities of the Student Research Workshop Chairs: 1. Student Research Workshop Planning & Submission 2. Student Mentorship Program 3. Student Funding & Travel Grants Breakdown of Responsibilities 1. Student Research Workshop Planning & Submission The Student Research Workshop (SRW) is a forum to bring together students investigating various areas of Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for participants to present their work and to receive mentorship and valuable feedback from the international research community. The workshop\u2019s goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education, including undergraduate, MSc/MA, junior and senior PhD students, in getting familiar with conducting and presenting their research. A number of decisions can be made by the SRW Chairs, including: * Accepting both archival (i.e., included in conference proceedings) and non-archival (i.e., presented at the workshop but not published in proceedings) papers. * Criteria for student status (i.e., full-time v. part-time, level of education [UG, PG, PhD], whether student status must be proven at the point of submission, etc.). * Policy on joint submissions with other conferences (excluding joint submission to both student and main conference sessions, which should be prohibited).

Student Mentorship Program The purpose of the Mentorship Program is to provide student researchers with an opportunity to discuss their ideas and receive constructive feedback from more experienced members of the computational linguistics community. Mentorship activities include detailed feedback on the writing, presentation, and content of submitted papers, helping authors polish their manuscripts before the final peer-review stage. As part of the program, authors are encouraged to upload their manuscripts to a shared drive before the submission deadline. Mentors\u2014selected from a pool of senior researchers\u2014are then assigned one or two papers each via email. After the feedback deadline, mentors upload their comments in the form of annotated files through a shared submission form, which are then returned to the corresponding authors.

If the number of nominated papers turns out to be much higher, this process will not scale. Best paper award chairs have latitude and discretion for the design of the selection process. PCs should approve the process. Whilst a specific rubric is not defined, committee members should consider the following aspects when reviewing award nominees: 1. Is each paper either fascinating, controversial, surprising, impressive, or potentially field-changing? Note that papers do not need to demonstrate all of these properties; any property is sufficient. 2. Does the paper present as its motivating use case an application with significant negative social impact? Even if the motivating use case is an application with neutral or positive social impact, are there obvious applications with significant negative social impact which are left unaddressed or insufficiently addressed by the paper? (In such cases, the paper should not be an award candidate.) 3. Is the work presented in the paper reproducible? For example, is there sufficient information in the paper to repeat the experiments? If not, is the lack of reproducibility justified in the paper? 4. Do the awards highlight a broad range of research types and strengths? 5. Do the awards include types of research that can be conducted at small labs? 6. Do the awards include papers that show excellence in potential positive social impact?

Gathering statistics and formulate Opening Ceremony slides June 2025 June 2025 Task XVII. Deliverables: Report and Documentation June 2025 July 2025 Task Description Task I: Set up the plan with expectations and deadlines After initial communication with the general chair and any information we could gather from past years we set up a plan with tasks, expectations, dependencies and timelines in order to meet all the necessary deadlines and accommodate the international participants in ACL 2025. The initial plan needed to be updated, once we were introduced to the strict requirements from the Vienna Convention Bureau and we decided to aim for a channel of communication with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Task II: Coordination with Other Chairs and the ACL Organizer Effective visa processing required close coordination with multiple chairs and the ACL main organizer to ensure alignment, accuracy, and timely action. We coordinated with: Local chairs for official recommendations offered by the hosting country related to visa applicants Website chairs to merge our changes in the webpage of ACL 2025 Visa Workshop chairs to identify the last date of papers\u2019 notifications and the best way to accommodate workshop participants Publicity and Social Media chairs to share our round 2 and 3 of filling out the list ACL organizer on how to handle requests on Phase II ACL Director of Events to coordinate on the registration dates and set the expectations. Task III: ACL 2025 Visa Webpage: Publish and Constant Updates We gathered information about 1/ who needs a visa, 2/ who doesn\u2019t need a visa, 3/ visa categories, and 4/ Austrian embassies locations across the world. The first version of the website was pushed to github by us on March 10th, 2025. On March 26th, we updated the webpage with recommendations we received from the Vienna Convention Bureau and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding the representative Austrian embassies per country around the world. Since then, we have updated the website regularly to address the updates for ACL 2025 visa, such as the different rounds for filling out the form and instructions on how to obtain an invitation letter for visa purposes before and after registration was open. To reduce repetitive inquiries and improve communication efficiency, we developed a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section in the ACL 2025 Visa webpage. The content was based on common inquiries received with questions grouped by frequency and relevance. Task IV: Outreach to Visa Chairs from Related Conferences To better understand the scope and expectations of our role, we proactively reached out to the NAACL 2025 Visa Chairs to seek advice, best practices, and any documentation they could share. In addition, we reviewed calls and materials from previous ACL and related conferences to gather relevant insights. This outreach helped us clarify a few of the expectations and responsibilities of our role. Task V: Design Invitation Letter Templates We developed a standardized invitation letter template based on the past requirements for invitation letters offered by similar conferences. In designing the template, we prioritized both clarity and security to ensure the document would be accepted by Austrian authorities while minimizing the risk of misuse or forgery. Key considerations included consistent formatting, inclusion of essential details, and incorporating features that enhance the authenticity of the letters issued by Visa Chairs on behalf of ACL 2025. We crafted several invitation letter templates for different roles, 1/ for organizing committee members, 2/ for tutorial presenters, 3/ for authors prior to registration, 4/ others, based on customization requests. Task VI: Communication with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs We initiated and established a direct communication channel with a representative from the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is important to highlight that this practice is not typically a standard process for ACL conferences. This outreach was led proactively by the ACL 2025 Visa Chairs, and we are especially grateful for the cooperation of the Austrian official who facilitated communication with over 350 Austrian embassies worldwide. The primary objective was to highlight the significance of international participation at ACL 2025 and explore ways embassies could support and accommodate the expected increase in visa applications. This collaboration played a key role in prioritising the ACL 2025 participants in the Austrian embassies, and having their visa applications on a fast track for approval. As part of this effort, we: Collected and consolidated specific visa requirements as requested by the Ministry. Submitted a detailed report of the conference\u2019s importance and description of the financial coverage for each participant (the ACL 2025 covers the coffee breaks and meals during the days and hours of the conference, while the participants are responsible to sponsor their travel, accommodation and any additional expense) Submitted the invitation letter templates to the relevant national bureau for review and validation. Conducted three rounds of forms to collect accurate participants\u2019 data (see Task VII) to prioritise their visa application procedure. Task VII: Run Three Rounds of Visa Request Forms As guided by contacts in the embassy, we created a form to collect personal information of the visa applicant to be shared with the embassies. The form was published on March 31st. The necessary for the visa application was name, family name, date of birth, sex, nationality, passport number, embassy location in which they will apply for a visa, email, phone number. We shared the information with the embassy in 3 rounds, 1/ after the main conference notification (May 19th), 2/ after workshop paper notification (for majority of them by June 3rd), and 3/ final round to accommodate late requests (June 20th). Our initial arrangement with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was for only two rounds, but they were kind enough to understand the difficult situation of accommodating the late paper notifications and reaching out to all ACL 2025 participants. The collected information was used to validate and expedite the applications across Austrian embassies in the world. Task VIII: Manually Compiled Invitation Letters We generated plenty of invitation letters manually, mainly prior to May 21st. From May 21st, applicants were redirected to obtain a visa letter via registration automatically. The invitation letter via registration was managed by Yes Events. Task IX: Media and Announcements Communication We coordinated closely with the Social Media Chairs to disseminate key visa-related updates through official conference channels. Our goal was to ensure timely, clear, and consistent messaging to support ACL 2025 participants requiring visa assistance. This included the promotion of critical deadlines, reminders for form submissions, and announcements regarding each round of visa processing. Task X: Direct Communication with Austrian Embassies We were directly contacted by Austrian embassies worldwide that faced issues while processing the visa applications of ACL 2025 participants. In several cases, embassies reached out to us regarding individuals who were not included on the official fast-track list, prompting us to verify their details and provide additional documentation. We also shared participant information upon request, including the data submitted through our visa form. We clarified ACL 2025\u2019s financial responsibility where it was requested. Task XI: Responding to Visa Inquiries and Urgent Requests As Visa Chairs, we managed a high volume of questions and urgent requests from ACL 2025 participants. Our responses focused on clarifying the scope of our role, addressing misinformation, and offering timely guidance. Common inquiries included: whether we could influence embassy decisions (we could not), whether we could directly affect an embassy\u2019s visa priority list (participants included in the official list were processed faster, while others followed standard procedures), whether we could extend invitation letters to include partners or family members (we could not). We also frequently redirected participants to specific sections of the ACL 2025 Visa webpage for detailed information, ensuring consistency and accuracy in communication. All urgent requests, such as those involving tight travel timelines, or unclear embassy instructions, were addressed within 24 hours. These included providing clarification on the level of support we could offer, sharing the official contact phone number and address of the inviting organization, and offering personalized guidance in complex cases that involved special attention and treatment in coordination with the Ministry. Task XII: Participation in OC Meetings Attend regular Organizing Committee (OC) meetings to stay aligned with overall ACL 2025 deadlines and planning, share updates, flag potential issues, and coordinate with other chairs. Task XIII: Large-Scale Email Dissemination We conducted multiple rounds of large-scale email outreach to ensure accurate and timely visa processing. Emails were sent based on data collected through the visa support form and were primarily aimed at: notifying participants once registration opened and the could obtain their invitation letters after registering, prompting attendees to complete the form during the final round of data collection in coordination with other chairs, performing targeted follow-ups for data verification. These checks included correcting invalid or incomplete passport numbers, and clarifying embassy selection when participants entered incorrect or inconsistent information. This communication effort was essential to maintain data quality and avoid delays in visa letter issuance. Task XIV: Collaborative Decision-Making for Non-Standard Visa Cases As Visa Chairs, we frequently encountered inquiries that required individualized attention and decisions beyond the scope of standard procedures. To ensure fair and consistent handling of these cases, we engaged in regular internal coordination to determine appropriate courses of action. This included how to address exceptional or urgent requests, whether to launch a third round of visa letters, how to format and finalize documentation, and how to manage modifications to official invitation letters. We also discussed how to respond to vague or incomplete email inquiries in a manner that was both supportive and compliant. These decisions required thoughtful collaboration to balance participant needs with ACL policies and the requirements of Austrian embassies, while maintaining fairness, transparency, and flexibility wherever possible. Task XV: Setting Up Best Practices for Embassy Data Collection Following ACL 2025\u2019s coordination efforts with the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry is now considering the development of formal best practices for collecting and transmitting data to Austrian embassies in support of visa processing for international conferences and large-scale academic events. This initiative was prompted in part by logistical challenges experienced during ACL 2025, including technical issues such as the loss of number codes due to limitations in the participant data input forms. In a follow-up call with the Ministry\u2019s representative, we shared feedback and offered several recommendations to improve future procedures. These included the creation of a standardized, secure data-collection platform within the Ministry\u2019s internal systems, with full compliance with GDPR and privacy regulations. The aim is to streamline embassy workflows, reduce manual errors, minimise data leakage risks, and better accommodate the needs of international academic communities attending events in Austria. Task XVI: Gathering Statistics and Opening Ceremony Slides We have so far been included in over 600 emails, including tickets from ACL Rolling Review fresh desk or direct emails. About 120 contained Urgent requests, which we addressed in the 24-48 hours. Urgent emails typically required customized invitation letters, correction in invitation letters, requests to contact embassies directly to share the invitation for the applicant and further supporting rejected visa applications. We developed a survey to gather feedback about the ACL 2025 visa applicants application results. The survey was run a 48h before the conference and the main question was whether applicants got their visa approved in time, provided our support. From a representative set of responses, we estimated a ~90% success rate, despite all the challenges and tight period of time for applications. Visa rejections and delays came from ~70% not following our recommendations (ie. not applying in a representative Austrian embassy, or applying via VFS). Task XVII: Deliverables: Report and Documentation We were instructed to provide the Q3 report and documentation of tasks. As ACL conferences continue to grow significantly, organising them has become increasingly complex. One key challenge is the lack of clear and updated documentation outlining the roles of chairs, along with milestones, tasks, timelines, and potential task dependencies. This gap makes organising the ACL conference really challenging given its size. To support this initiative, we were requested to create a documentation excel on the following: A list of the major tasks and milestones associated with our chair role. The corresponding timeline for these tasks and milestones (e.g., specific deadlines or timeframes). Any dependencies that may impact the completion of specific tasks (e.g., Task A requires input from Task B, or Task B being completed first).","title":"Visa Chair Handbook"},{"location":"2025/visa/#visa-chair-handbook","text":"","title":"Visa Chair Handbook"},{"location":"2025/visa/#current-chairs","text":"Name Affiliation Contact Rexhina Blloshmi Amazon AGI blloshmi@amazon.com Eleni Ilkou University of Hannover ilkou.el@gmail.com","title":"Current Chairs:"},{"location":"2025/visa/#overview-of-responsibilities","text":"The Visa Chairs at *CL conferences are responsible for assisting members of the ACL Community with the process of gaining visas to attend ACL activities.

Breakdown of Responsibilities 1. Planning This responsibility establishes the scope of the SV selection process. SV Chairs should contact the previous year\u2019s chairs to review materials, gather templates, and incorporate lessons learned. They also should contact the event assistant to confirm the expected number of in-person, reserve, and virtual volunteers in advance, which guides selection planning and applicant communication. Coordination with the Diversity & Inclusion and Visa Chairs is recommended early on to help maximize equitable distribution of volunteer slots and ensure timely support for applicants requiring visas.

Recruitment & Selection This responsibility concerns opening the Call for Volunteers, collecting applications, and selecting a group of volunteers along with a small reserve list. SV Chairs should adapt and validate the application form, coordinate with the event assistant, and disseminate the call well in advance of the deadline. Selection criteria are determined by the SV Chairs and may include factors such as paper authorship at the main conference or workshops, financial need, geographic diversity, previous volunteer experience, and first-time *ACL attendance. The call should specify volunteer availability expectations (e.g., be present for the full conference, including the day before the conference for registration).

Communications with Volunteers This responsibility involves managing all communication channels and correspondence with student volunteers throughout the process. SV Chairs handle a high volume of emails and requests, requiring organized communication systems and clear protocols. Communication Setup: Prior to opening the call for volunteers, SV Chairs should establish a shared email address managed by both chairs or create a Google Group to be published on the ACL website. This official email address is essential for all communication processes. Using a dedicated email account prevents personal accounts from being blocked due to high email volume and ensures continuity of communication. Notification Process: After the selection process, SV Chairs send acceptance/rejection notifications with attached letters to four categories of volunteers: accepted in-person, accepted virtual, shortlisted, and rejected. Templates for these notification letters are provided by the event manager to ensure consistency and professionalism. Communication Management: To streamline communication, SV Chairs should send a FAQ email to all volunteers addressing common questions and concerns. The FAQ should specify a communication format for volunteer emails, such as \"Name_Surname_Role_RequestKeyword\" to facilitate efficient processing and response. Peak Communication Periods: The highest volume of communication occurs between acceptance notifications and the early registration deadline. During this period, volunteers typically have questions about logistics, requirements, and procedures. Additionally, significant communication with the event manager is required to report special situations and volunteer withdrawals. Role Change Requests: Many communication requests involve volunteers asking to switch their role (e.g., from in-person to virtual). To minimize these requests, SV Chairs should clearly specify role change policies and limitations directly in the acceptance email.

Managing Communication with ACL Workshop Organizers \\ 3. Workshop Infrastructure and Planning Breakdown of Responsibilities 1. Cross-Committee Coordination In recent years, the selection of workshops has been made in unison with other conferences such as NAACL, EACL, AACL, EMNLP, etc. as appropriate. This helps ensure a variety of topics across conference locations and creates a more diverse pool for submissions.

Notes on the Workshop Selection Process: - Large workshops are pre-admitted: *SEM, WMT, CoNLL, other workshops that will have more than 100 participants (SemEval). However, the chairs need to get their venue preferences for the year. - Hold an online survey among ACL members (get mailing list from the ACL Office) asking them to indicate which workshops they would likely attend. - Consideration criteria include: Past interest, interest according to the survey, diversity, quality of the organizing team, size of the workshop, and novelty. 2.

The guidelines link to two additional spreadsheets, explained further below: a detailed site-specific expenses spreadsheet to be filled as part of the submission, synchronized with the bid document; a task-list spreadsheet, which details many of the tasks involved in hosting the conference and suggests several options for delegating a varying amount of the work to the ACL office (acl at aclweb.org) and/or to a professional conference organizer. Preliminary and Final Bids You are first requested to submit a preliminary bid. Promising bidders will be asked by the Conference Coordinating Committee to provide additional information and turn their bid into the final one, according to the schedule published in the Call for Bids. The purpose of a preliminary bid is to give the committee a detailed description of the organization, venue, and setting. The first round of review will help bidders to create a stronger bid, which is better tailored to the needs of the ACL. The purpose of the final bid is to convince the committee that the organizers are capable of running a large scientific conference with considerable professionalism and attention to detail. Covering Letter Include a cover letter addressed to the ACL, naming venue and possible dates, identifying contact person(s) and contact details, signed. Organization Local Organizing Committee : Please name the members of the local organizing committee, including titles and affiliations. For each person, provide a statement about their activities in the CL community and their experience in organizing scientific events (and the number of participants at those events). Local CL Community : Describe the profile of the local CL community, including any research groups, graduate programs, professional bodies, companies. Professional Conference Organizer : It is typically advisable to involve a Professional Conference Organizer (PCO) for the local organization, while the amount of work delegated to the PCO might vary. Where geographically appropriate, the ACL office might take responsibility for typical tasks of a PCO. Specify (roughly) the intended split of tasks between the local organizers, a PCO and/or the ACL office (see the Task List Spreadsheet section below for detail). Identify the organization that will be responsible for such tasks as local arrangements, including venues, catering, accommodation, the social program, and finances. What is the scale of their operation? List major scientific meetings organized recently by the PCO and their size. Dates : Bidders should indicate one or more options for the conference dates. Sometimes, additional alternatives might be explored when negotiating with the committee. When planning the dates please check first with the conference committee chair for the latest known constraints for that year, such as dates of related conferences. Venue Conference : Describe the main auditorium, theatres for 6-7 parallel sessions, spaces for tutorials and workshops, large exhibit area or ballroom for posters/demos/exhibits/coffee breaks, and an option for meeting rooms on-demand. Describe capacity, seating style, A/V facilities, sloping vs level floor, availability of (fold-out) tables in theatres, ceiling height (especially in the smaller workshop and tutorial rooms). Workshops - capacity for 3 two-day workshops, and 20-26 one-day workshops (13-16 per each day) Tutorials - eight tutorials, half in the morning and half in the afternoon (4 rooms) Dates for which the venues have been booked. Accommodation : List categories of accommodation, considering students as well, and their approximate capacities and prices. State the proximity of the accommodation to the conference venue, and the means of access. Dates for which room blocks have been tentatively reserved, or are available. Food and Social Program : Describe plans for breaks (2 per day, mid-morning and mid-afternoon), student lunch (can be off-site; for at least 100-150 students), welcome reception (for about 50-60% of expected attendance), and social event (typically 40-50% of expected attendance). Provide a preliminary plan of the types/quantities of foods per participant to be provided at each of these events, matching their cost in the site-specific expenses spreadsheet. Estimated Costs Summary : Provide a one-page summary of the site-specific expenses spreadsheet (see below), specifying approximate total cost for each component of the conference (main conference, tutorials, workshops, social program, overheads) and the VAT situation (or similar taxes \u2013 see comment in expenses spreadsheet). Please give figures in both local currency and US dollars, and specify the exchange rate. Include any further relevant explanations for your expenses spreadsheet. Setting Map : Provide a detailed map showing positions of venues and accommodation, and other relevant locations (if any \u2013 e.g. food courts, subway/bus stops). Food : Describe the eating options within and near the conference venue. City : Describe the city and region, and the principal attractions. What is the climate at this time of year? Any optional social program. List public cultural events scheduled for the conference period. Transportation : Describe the air and ground transportation that provides access to the city. What is the commute time from regional airport(s) and railway stations to the venue? Extras (Not needed for preliminary bid) Letters of support Photographs of venues and regional attractions Evidence of sponsorship Information about visa, driver licenses Site-Specific Expenses Spreadsheet Site-specific expenses should be detailed in a separate Expenses spreadsheet with which the bid document should be consistent. The spreadsheet includes only items which vary from one venue to another. Costs which are largely fixed across venues (such as proceedings and invited speakers) are omitted, and so are all aspects of income except for local sponsorships. The final budget will be coordinated with the ACL Treasurer and business office. Do not change the spreadsheet in any way, except to populate the yellow and blue cells with your local data. It is important that all bidders submit comparable spreadsheets (as live .xls files, not .pdf). If for some reason you feel that you need to modify the spreadsheet to fit your local conditions, please seek the advice of the Coordinating Committee Chair and the Treasurer before doing so. Most items in the spreadsheet are self-explained or include explanatory comments. Here are some additional guidelines: Some expenses will have both a constant component and a per-person component, and each line of the spreadsheet includes both components. For example, the social event might have a base cost for the venue rental plus a per-person cost as well. In most cases, however, only one component will be non-zero. Complete the spreadsheet in your local currency, and provide a multiplicative conversion factor for USD in the appropriate cell, along with the date on which the exchange rate was valid. The spreadsheet total costs are computed using both conservative (lower-bound) assumptions for the size of the conference and optimistic (upper-bound) assumptions, as specified in the first lines of the spreadsheet. However, when considering venue and accommodation capacities, only upper-bound assumptions should be made, as specified in the relevant spreadsheet lines (there might be some flexibility here according to actual conditions, e.g., possibly not all rooms for parallel sessions will reach the maximal session capacity). With respect to overall cost for the social event, the ticket price should typically not exceed USD 75. Beyond that attendance drops off, which pushes the per-person cost even higher because of constants such as venue rental, risking a serious loss. Equipment-related costs should include security arrangements, if relevant. If you find any problems or bugs in the spreadsheet, please notify David Yarowsky (ACL Treasurer). Task List Spreadsheet As mentioned above, the organizers may choose to delegate a varying amount of the organization work to a Professional Conference Organizer (PCO) and/or to the ACL Office. As auxiliary information for your task planning, we supply a task list spreadsheet (File:Tasklist.xlsx). The spreadsheet lists many of the organization tasks and specifies three prototypical models for sharing the organization load. Option A represents the maximum amount of work for the local organizers, while Option C is the least amount of work. B is in between. Please indicate, in the PCO section of the BID, which of these three models captures best your preferred model and include relevant explanation as needed. The precise details of who does what will be further discussed with promising bidders, you are not committing to specific tasks at this point. The expenses items under the administration section, and particularly Conference Management Fees, should correspond to the cost of work planned for a PCO and/or the ACL office. Please discuss directly with the ACL office the plans and costs. Additional Information Further relevant information may be found at the ACL Conference Handbook and Policies . Successful sample bids for previous conferences may be found at the Bids Archive (follow the current guidelines when preparing your bid). For any queries please contact the Coordinating Committee chair. Evaluation of Bids Proposals will be evaluated according to the following criteria (unordered): Experience of local arrangements team Local CL community support Local government and industry support Accessibility and attractiveness of proposed site Suitability of proposed dates Adequacy of conference and exhibit facilities for the anticipated number of registrants Adequacy of residence accommodations and food services in a range of price categories and close to the conference facilities Adequacy of expense projections Geographical balance with regard to prior ACL and other CL meetings in the region.","title":"Bid Guidelines"},{"location":"pre_2024/bid_guidelines/#bid-guidelines","text":"This page provides guidelines for preparing a bid for hosting the ACL conference.

Emails sent to the conference mailing list can also be forwarded to some mail management portal (aka ticket management software) such as Freshdesk so that chairs can supervise the procedure. Note that the ACL Rolling Review team has set up an ACL account on Freshdesk. Jonathan Kummerfeld is the person in charge of this account. When triaging emails through Freshdesk, a filter is added to sort emails (i.e. separate mails concerning submissions / ACL Rolling Review from mails concerning other matters). Two internal communication co-chairs are usually appointed to share the workload. One way to coordinate triaging is to use an online shared folder (e.g. on a drive) containing the list of Conference chairs and the following files : a shared calendar where each of the communication chairs can indicate her/his availabilities ; an internal FAQ where each of the communication chairs can copy/paste already answered questions. In some cases, two mailing lists are used by conference chairs (one for questions related to paper submission and one for all other questions). This may lead to emails sent to the wrong address. On top of emails, several other communication channels between chairs are generally used (e.g. instant messaging / slack channels). It is important to define how to best communicate with each other (i.e. which channel to prioritize). Some recommendations : use some long-lasting editing facility (e.g. the ACL wiki) to share the internal FAQ so that communication chairs can benefit from work done at previous editions ; have a local contact point for visa questions as early as possible in order to be able to direct questions appropriately and get concrete information ; share a common retro-planning (timeline) with the main dates regarding not only the publication process but also the conference organization (many people will ask when will registration be open, or when will the information about presentation guidelines available, etc.). It would be helpful to announce these dates on the conference website as soon as possible (or at least to share them with communication chairs). Additional In-depth Information / Tips and Tricks About Freshdesk management Freshdesk management is a daily job from multiple members. IC chairs serve as the routers, dispatching tickets to PC / GC and any other kind of chair (publication chairs, workshop chairs and so on). IC chairs represent the customer service, the face of the conference assistance (while IC chairs never invent information, they serve as welcoming desk operators). This means a ticket should not stay without an answer for more than 1 or 2 days (excluding weekends maybe). An answer is simple to give : \"thank you for mentioning this issue, we will forward it to the PC chairs and let them reply to you directly\". When I started systematically replying, multiple participants replied immediately with positive feedback, knowing that their query was not lost, and did not fall into a robotic messaging system. However, IC's role in Freshdesk does not limit to this: the main role of IC is to ease the work for other chairs by serving as: - Automatic responders for direct information: i.e. when the IC is certain of an answer, they reply directly without bothering the other chairs. This information often comes from the website FAQ or website general information. sometimes it comes from the slack and direct discussions with PC/GC chairs - Automatic responders for updates / recurring questions: Many times, participants ask the same question again and again. Usually, when the question comes up several times in a row, the IC has to prevent answering and directly ask the suitable answer to the PC or relevant chairs. This will change the status of the answer to the previous bullet point (meaning it become general verified information to directly answer) - FAQ updater: IC has to update the FAQ with verified information (through pull requests). This really prevents a lot of spamming. Yes, surprisingly, participants look at the FAQ! IC chairs should maintain an internal FAQ for elements to add or not in the official FAQ (the website) later on. - Information gathering: information comes from many sources (PC, GC, Underline, a simple whova post, etc.). IC definitely has to merge all this information into one document. this eases fixes and following directions from the GC (or PC) - Filtering/quick lookup provider: Freshdesk is cute at first, then it gradually becomes a hellish stack of tickets of many kinds. During ACL 24 I added a TLDR at the beginning of each forwarded ticket for the other chairs. Program chairs heavily relies on this, it really saves them a lot of time prioritizing tickets (i.e. they did not read the tickets anymore, but only the tiny TL;DR to choose to respond now or later on). Here are two examples : \"this issue comes from a gold sponsor, please look into it\" or \"and yet another person looking for a refund\" (here hinting at the repetition is important to help PC and ACL finance persons). - On the lookup for everything about communication during the conference: it would be better to say the IC cannot enjoy the scientific talks. They have to get information, sometimes in person, to dispatch it to the participants on Whova. Expected Workload IC chairs also have to prepare time for the incoming conference : 1 hour / day at first ; then 2 hours / day ; then 4 hours/day ; finally almost full time during the conference. Moderation during the conference Whova micro-blogging and moderation is essentially the work of both IC and Virtual Chairs. IC chairs should be on the lookup for the \"ask organizers anything\" mandatory forum in whova. and they should use all their previous information gathering/dispatching work to do the same. Providing statistics / metrics Providing metrics is important to have an idea of the workload / number of tickets. While it mainly serves as an indicator, please find the ones from ACL 2024 workload for Freshdesk. To create charts, you need to customize Freshdesk along with ccreating your own files / scripts. There is no standard way to do it. You can find examples from 2024 here: stats folder Also, here is a couple of charts that gives you an idea of the workload to expect: Tips and Tricks Being notified from PCs for announcements to participants. If possible, big announcements should be dispatched to the IC chairs. This often helps explain why there have been 200 tickets in one day when we wake up the next morning (e.g. after the PC chairs announced paper acceptance, etc.) Conference days. During the conference days and one week before the conference, Whova + Freshdesk + in-person communication essentially takes the whole time. Those are crazy days (but nothing short compared to PC chairs I suppose). Faster management: copy-paste to forward to chairs. Being able to respond fast is mandatory. IC chairs need to forward many tickets to the emails preferred by each chair. To keep up with this, please find there a markdown file with sections dedicated to quickly copy-paste the list of emails I need. The process is simple : triple clic ; CTRL + C ; alt+tab ; CTRL+V This saves a lot of time and prevents any mistakes compared to only relying on the shared excel file.

Emails sent to the conference mailing list can also be forwarded to some mail management portal (aka ticket management software) such as Freshdesk so that chairs can supervise the procedure. Note that the ACL Rolling Review team has set up an ACL account on Freshdesk. Jonathan Kummerfeld is the person in charge of this account. When triaging emails through Freshdesk, a filter is added to sort emails (i.e. separate mails concerning submissions / ACL Rolling Review from mails concerning other matters). Two internal communication co-chairs are usually appointed to share the workload. One way to coordinate triaging is to use an online shared folder (e.g. on a drive) containing the list of Conference chairs and the following files : a shared calendar where each of the communication chairs can indicate her/his availabilities ; an internal FAQ where each of the communication chairs can copy/paste already answered questions. In some cases, two mailing lists are used by conference chairs (one for questions related to paper submission and one for all other questions). This may lead to emails sent to the wrong address. On top of emails, several other communication channels between chairs are generally used (e.g. instant messaging / slack channels). It is important to define how to best communicate with each other (i.e. which channel to prioritize). Some recommendations : use some long-lasting editing facility (e.g. the ACL wiki) to share the internal FAQ so that communication chairs can benefit from work done at previous editions ; have a local contact point for visa questions as early as possible in order to be able to direct questions appropriately and get concrete information ; share a common retro-planning (timeline) with the main dates regarding not only the publication process but also the conference organization (many people will ask when will registration be open, or when will the information about presentation guidelines available, etc.). It would be helpful to announce these dates on the conference website as soon as possible (or at least to share them with communication chairs).","title":"Internal Communication Chair"},{"location":"pre_2024/communication/#additional-in-depth-information-tips-and-tricks","text":"","title":"Additional In-depth Information / Tips and Tricks"},{"location":"pre_2024/communication/#about-freshdesk-management","text":"Freshdesk management is a daily job from multiple members. IC chairs serve as the routers, dispatching tickets to PC / GC and any other kind of chair (publication chairs, workshop chairs and so on). IC chairs represent the customer service, the face of the conference assistance (while IC chairs never invent information, they serve as welcoming desk operators). This means a ticket should not stay without an answer for more than 1 or 2 days (excluding weekends maybe). An answer is simple to give : \"thank you for mentioning this issue, we will forward it to the PC chairs and let them reply to you directly\". When I started systematically replying, multiple participants replied immediately with positive feedback, knowing that their query was not lost, and did not fall into a robotic messaging system. However, IC's role in Freshdesk does not limit to this: the main role of IC is to ease the work for other chairs by serving as: - Automatic responders for direct information: i.e. when the IC is certain of an answer, they reply directly without bothering the other chairs. This information often comes from the website FAQ or website general information. sometimes it comes from the slack and direct discussions with PC/GC chairs - Automatic responders for updates / recurring questions: Many times, participants ask the same question again and again. Usually, when the question comes up several times in a row, the IC has to prevent answering and directly ask the suitable answer to the PC or relevant chairs. This will change the status of the answer to the previous bullet point (meaning it become general verified information to directly answer) - FAQ updater: IC has to update the FAQ with verified information (through pull requests). This really prevents a lot of spamming. Yes, surprisingly, participants look at the FAQ! IC chairs should maintain an internal FAQ for elements to add or not in the official FAQ (the website) later on. - Information gathering: information comes from many sources (PC, GC, Underline, a simple whova post, etc.). IC definitely has to merge all this information into one document. this eases fixes and following directions from the GC (or PC) - Filtering/quick lookup provider: Freshdesk is cute at first, then it gradually becomes a hellish stack of tickets of many kinds. During ACL 24 I added a TLDR at the beginning of each forwarded ticket for the other chairs. Program chairs heavily relies on this, it really saves them a lot of time prioritizing tickets (i.e. they did not read the tickets anymore, but only the tiny TL;DR to choose to respond now or later on). Here are two examples : \"this issue comes from a gold sponsor, please look into it\" or \"and yet another person looking for a refund\" (here hinting at the repetition is important to help PC and ACL finance persons). - On the lookup for everything about communication during the conference: it would be better to say the IC cannot enjoy the scientific talks.

During the conference days and one week before the conference, Whova + Freshdesk + in-person communication essentially takes the whole time. Those are crazy days (but nothing short compared to PC chairs I suppose). Faster management: copy-paste to forward to chairs. Being able to respond fast is mandatory. IC chairs need to forward many tickets to the emails preferred by each chair. To keep up with this, please find there a markdown file with sections dedicated to quickly copy-paste the list of emails I need. The process is simple : triple clic ; CTRL + C ; alt+tab ; CTRL+V This saves a lot of time and prevents any mistakes compared to only relying on the shared excel file.

Additionally, they must address special requests, such as wheelchair rentals and childcare, and collaborate with the local chairs to ensure these needs are met. The regular duties are as follows: D&I Subsidy Allocation : This role involves managing the call for D&I subsidies, creating and preparing the application form, and making decisions on subsidy allocation\u2014one of the D&I Chairs' most essential responsibilities. D&I subsidies provide financial assistance to individuals from underrepresented or disadvantaged groups, helping to cover expenses such as travel, registration, and accommodations, thereby fostering greater participation and inclusivity at the conference. The suggested working timeline is as follows: Before the paper notification , the D&I Chairs should start by creating an online application form (e.g., using Microsoft Forms or Google Forms) to gather essential information from applicants, including personal details, paper information (e.g., main conference/Findings/workshop papers, long/short papers), first-time attendance status, student status, financial situation, and whether a visa is needed to attend the conference. They can design the structure and content of the form based on the information they consider important for determining subsidy allocation and refer to forms from previous conferences to identify additional useful details to include in the application process. After the paper notification , they can put the call-for-page for D&I subsidies , ensuring it is published after the notification of acceptance (so authors know they will have the opportunity to present their work). The page should clearly specify the types of expenses covered by the subsidies, such as travel costs, registration fees, membership fees, and pre-paid accommodations (arranged by the ACL business team). The page should also include a link to the online application form, the email contact information for the chairs, the application deadline, and the notification date. It is recommended that the notification be sent out before the early-bird registration deadline, allowing applicants who do not receive subsidies to still register at the discounted early-bird rate. For guidance, the chairs can refer to call-for-pages from previous conferences. Once the page is finalized, the D&I Chairs can collaborate with the Website Chairs to publish it on the conference website and seek assistance from the Publicity Chairs to promote the call. While waiting for the applications , the chairs should coordinate with the ACL business team to determine the subsidies available for the conference , which can be funded through two sources: ACL and conference sponsors. They can also discuss within the D&I team to establish a policy for allocating the subsidies , such as providing partial support to a larger number of applicants or offering full support to fewer individuals. After the application deadline , the chairs should review all applications and shortlist candidates for D&I subsidies allocation. The chairs need to estimate the costs of registration, membership, travel, and pre-paid accommodations. Travel costs are determined based on the applicants' locations, while membership and registration fees depend on student status and geographic location (e.g., ACL provides Reduced Rate Memberships: https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/membership-fees). The hotel pricing for pre-paid accommodations should be provided by the ACL business team. The pre-paid accommodations typically include shared rooms, and the D&I chairs are responsible for pairing awardees for shared accommodations. When making decisions, the D&I chairs are encouraged to collaborate with the Student Volunteer Chairs to determine if a D&I awardee has already been granted a student volunteer position (allowing the registration fee to be excluded from the subsidies). At the time of sending notifications , The chairs should send out three types of notifications : a rejection letter for applicants who were not awarded subsidies, an award letter for recipients who do not require pre-paid accommodations, and an award letter for recipients who require pre-paid accommodations, requesting scanned passport pages for the ACL business team to arrange hotel bookings. Since travel costs are provided through reimbursement, the award letters should clearly specify the reimbursement cap, excluding the cost of pre-paid hotels, registration, and membership fees, if applicable. The excluded components are part of the subsidy package but will be directly waived rather than reimbursed. It is recommended that the chairs set a deadline for awardees to accept the subsidies to ensure better utilization of funds (e.g., subsidies declined by awardees can be reallocated to other applicants). Discounted Virtual Registration : It is designed to make ACL events accessible to researchers who would otherwise be unable to attend in person and offers an additional opportunity for those who did not receive D&I subsidies to participate virtually. Authors with accepted papers to the conference do not qualify for this program. Students needing financial assistance can apply for D&I subsidies and volunteer grants. The virtual subsidy is available to those in greatest financial need, except in the case of special circumstances. This additional funding is not intended for employed individuals and funded students from the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and higher-income countries in Asia and the Middle East. Standard student registration rates (including those from these regions) are already substantially discounted. The proposed working timeline is as follows: The chairs first post a Call for Discounted Virtual Registration accompanied by an online form for applicants to submit their information (similar to the process for D&I subsidies). The chairs can also refer to the call from previous conferences to better understand what should be included in the application form. Similar to the D&I subsidies, it is recommended to issue notifications before the early-bird registration deadline, allowing unsuccessful applicants to register at the early-bird rate. The chairs should then shortlist the awardees and assign varying levels of discounts . Unlike the D&I subsidies, there is no quota or funding cap as long as the list is approved by the ACL executive committee. However, the chairs should determine the level of discount for each awardee\u2014for instance, $0, $50, or $100 for virtual registration\u2014based on factors such as student status and geographic location. They can also decide whether to waive the membership fee. After shortlisting, the chairs should share their recommendations with the ACL Equity Director to seek approval from the ACL Executive Committee. They can refer to this page (https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Officers) to identify the appropriate points of contact. Once the shortlists are approved, the D&I chairs can proceed with sending notifications accordingly. D&I Activities Management : The chairs should organize D&I activities, such as Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions, affinity group meetings and mentoring sessions at the conference. The suggested timeline is as follows: First, check with the Local Chairs regarding the availability of rooms for D&I activities . Check with general chair whether the registration form will ask participants whether they are interested in organizing D&I activities. If the answer to the above is no, publish the Call for D&I Activities on the conference website (with assistance from the Website Chairs) to collect requests from attendees interested in organizing D&I activities, such as Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions and affinity group meetings. The call should include the application submission deadline and an online application form to gather details such as the activity name, organizers, preferred time, and the expected number of participants. After the application submission deadline, schedule the D&I activities based on the available room resources and the organizers' preferred times. Finally, inform both the organizers and the business team to include the activities in the conference program. Organise ACL Fellows Lunch : This is an initiative introduced in EMNLP 2024 where the D&I awardees get to meet with ACL fellows, a networking opportunity that might not otherwise get. The lunch should be funded by the D&I budget. Gather interest among D&I awardees by sending a quick form asking them whether they want to attend the lunch and what topics they would like to discuss about. Contact current ACL Fellows (ACL Business Manager can provide emails) asking them whether they are attending the conference and if they would be interested in participating in the event. Group awardees/fellows based on common research interests (or suggested topics of discussion). Book a restaurant (near the conference venue) and send everyone instructions on where/when to meet.

The first, a more frequently used plan, is running large, combined sessions that are typically held in the evening after talk sessions are over. Usually light dinner and drinks are served during these sessions. An alternative plan is to run poster sessions parallel to the talk sessions throughout the day. Both types have been used successfully in the past conferences. The following guideline, written for the first type of poster sessions, is thanks to Michael Strube, the program co-chair of ACL 2015. Below this is a more recent experience from ACL 2018 which describes another compelling layout, thanks to Trevor Cohn, local co-chair. Tips from ACL 2015 In recent years the poster session at ACLs has become increasingly important. About half of the papers are presented as posters. However, the general perception is that a poster presentation is less worth than an oral one. In order to do away with the \"poster stigma\" (an expression borrowed from the TACL editors-in-chief), we should organize poster sessions in a way that authors and audience will have the best experience possible. The following guidelines have been developed by observing the almost perfect poster session at ACL 2014 and evaluated by implementing the guidelines at ACL-IJCNLP 2015. Space and Time Most importantly, It is critical to ensure that sufficient space and time will be allocated for poster presentation. Space and time required are a function of the number of posters and the number of conference attendees. Recent ACLs had about 200 poster presentations (long and short papers, TACL papers, demos, SRW papers). These should be split into two poster sessions of about 100 posters, three hours each. The conferences had between 1100 and 1400 attendees. Hence we had one poster per 10 to 13 attendees per session. A poster should have enough space to accommodate the presenter and about (at least) five attendees. Also, attendees should be able to walk through the poster isles and browse posters without bumping into each other. This requires that each poster occupies a virtual box of about four by four meters, hence each poster requires about 16 square meters (please see the drawing below, artwork by Strube). For a poster session with 100 posters we need a room of about 1600 sqm. If food and drinks are served within this room, we need to add another 800 sqm, hence we need about 2400 sqm. When computing the space, we should also be careful about unusable space. For example, if there is a stage in the room for oral sessions, this most likely can't be removed but occupies a lot of space, emergency exits may occupy space along the walls. Other Considerations Posters have to be arranged by subject area so that attendees easily find the posters they want to explore in detail. Landscape orientation is preferred over portrait, because it allows more attendees to look at one poster simultaneously. An open space between posters allows for easier access to posters and makes a nicer atmosphere. Avoid creating closed isles. A three hour poster session with 100 posters is not the same as two 1 1/2 hour poster sessions with 50 posters each. The poster per attendee ratio changes dramatically. It won't work. Avoid putting events with conflicting setup (oral session, poster session, social event) in the same room, as the time to remove chairs, to set up and remove poster boards may be too long to allow for a smooth schedule. Serve beer during the poster session. Or else, workshop chairs will use the opportunity and make fun of the main conference poster session! Work closely together with the ACL Office as -- in contrast to us -- it knows what it is doing. Tips from ACL 2018 In ACL 2018 we had a large room for poster presentations and needed to accomodate many posters, to handle the growing numbers of papers at ACL. But we shared the poster room with exhibitors and several catering stations. The 16m2 per poster recommendation from ACL 2015 wasn't going to be possible, nor were long rows of poster boards. The layout ideally allows: Easy access to posters, so they can be viewed from a distance or up close A popular poster shouldn't crowd out nearby posters Easy routes for walking between posters, e.g., when overhearing a conversation nearby, can join in easily Flexibility to incorporate pillars, access doors, catering stations and other odd room shapes Make optimal use of limited floor space Our solutions was to have many triangles of poster boards, each housing three landscape posters facing outwards. This means that the viewing area for each poster doesn't impinge on the viewing area for other posters in the group, unlike what happens when they are side-by-side in a row of poster boards. We arranged each poster triangle so that the points of the triangle were directed towards the face fo posters on neighbouring triangles. (Confused? See sketch below.) This was so that the crowd around one poster didn't spill into the way of other nearby posters, which often happens when there are narrow rows of posters. The illustration shows each poster board in red, each of which is 1.4m across, leading to 12m2 space per poster. The black hexagons are simply guide-lines showing the \"virtual box\" for each cluster of posters, and from this pattern it's easy to extend the poster area by simply adding additional hexagons. It does require some geometry, and can be tricky to communicate to the conference venue, but it's worth the effort! Note that the pattern changes slightly at the walls, and sufficient space is needed to ensure that the wall mounted posters are still accessible. Pros/cons. When you can justify 16m2 per poster, then the ACL15 method above is probably best, so long as you put regular gaps between boards to let people get between corridors. This has the advantage of allowing people to cruise the posters more quickly, and see if anything piques their interest without feeling compelled to engage. The triangle layout makes it a bit harder to do this cursory scan. However it can make more efficient use of smaller rooms, incorporate obstacles (e.g., pillars in middle of triangles), and encourage more engagement with posters, as it is more intimate. It also supports more natural grouping of clusters of similar papers more coherently, rather than having them in a long line. It's also easier to spot people in the poster venue, as there are fewer interruptions to sight lines.","title":"Local organization - arranging the poster presentations"},{"location":"pre_2024/local_poster/#local-organization-arranging-the-poster-presentations","text":"There are two common ways of organizing poster sessions.

When you can justify 16m2 per poster, then the ACL15 method above is probably best, so long as you put regular gaps between boards to let people get between corridors. This has the advantage of allowing people to cruise the posters more quickly, and see if anything piques their interest without feeling compelled to engage. The triangle layout makes it a bit harder to do this cursory scan. However it can make more efficient use of smaller rooms, incorporate obstacles (e.g., pillars in middle of triangles), and encourage more engagement with posters, as it is more intimate. It also supports more natural grouping of clusters of similar papers more coherently, rather than having them in a long line. It's also easier to spot people in the poster venue, as there are fewer interruptions to sight lines.","title":"Tips from ACL 2018"},{"location":"pre_2024/local_rooms/","text":"Local organization - arranging the meeting rooms Meeting rooms The following meeting rooms are needed for ACL meetings: 1 room seating at least 750 people for plenary sessions, for the conference days ACL has parallel sessions.

These banners may contain also the logos of the principal funders. A bulletin board for attendee messages, with sufficient paper and writing and posting materials, must be provided near the registration area. A notice board for official announcements (workshops, birds of a feather meetings, etc.) must also be provided near registration. A board where job advertisements can be posted should also be provided. Exhibit Space The exhibit space must be locakable. It should be close to the conference meeting rooms and refreshment area. The Exhibits Chair will work with the Local Organization Committee to coordinate the setup (with pipe and drape stands, etc.), the influx of exhibitors (with demo needs, internet and phone access, signage, etc., and the teardown.

Often, this team consists of (around 30) students who volunteer to help in exchange for free conference registration. In the past, these students have been local to the conference site. Other times, student recipients of grants from the Walker Fund, or of other travel money, are volunteers. It is important to clarify who is required to register and on what terms. Local student and faculty volunteers play a crucial role in most ACLs, both before and during the conference. Some student volunteers will be non-local, and will do all their work during the conference. Others will be local, and may do some substantial proportion of their volunteer work before the conference; for example by helping with the preparation of booklets and similar, handling aspects of general planning, creating logos, and so on. Local staff or faculty other than the Local Organization Chair may also be substantially involved in various tasks, and should be clearly told whether to register, whether their registration will be paid, and so on. There is a need for a Volunteer co-ordinator who is responsible for planning the staffing of the conference. This involves substantial responsibility and is suitable for a mentally strong and socially confident senior local student or for a local faculty or staff member other than the local chair. Identifying this person should be done early, since the job involves working closely with the local chair and with the ACL secretary.

Have people walk around in these shirts early on, if you want others to buy them. People might buy such items on the last day, but they need some lead time to think about the purchase. Freebies (conference tote bags, umbrellas, sunglasses, pens, etc.) are available from specialty houses.

Student Chairs The student chairs of the Student Research Workshop are responsible for assembling the program committee, requesting student papers, selecting appropriate ones, arranging for their presentation (including the format, such as oral or posters, and if appropriate refreshments, presentation and computer requirements, and all other special needs). In addition, the student chairs are responsible for proposing travel grant recipients --- see policy on general student travel funding . This may include proposing funding allocations for student applicants for the full conference, not only for SRW participants -- the student chairs should coordinate with the general chair and the ACL Office about this. If the selected student papers are presented in a workshop, then the same general instructions apply as those that hold for workshop chairs (see Workshop Chairs ). The workshops must be self-financing (at least); any surplus belong to ACL, but may (with agreement by the Exec) be used to support invited speakers and students. See the SRW policies page for more information about the goals and policies of the SRW (though the page has not been updated for some time). Useful checklist of things to do (from a past student chair) Faculty Advisors The faculty advisors are responsible for: overseeing the organization of the SRW and providing suggestions to the student chairs ensuring that ACL student session policies are adhered to seeking funding for students to attend the ACL conference and in particular the ACL Student Research Workshop overseeing the selection of students to receive travel funding (see ACL policy on general student travel funding ) The faculty advisors are responsible for submitting proposals for funding to external funding agencies. ACL-05 proposal to NSF provides a sample proposal. However, efforts should be extended to funding agencies in Europe and Asia, since NSF restrictions can limit the travel funds that can be provided to students based outside the United States. The faculty advisors should begin seeking funding immediately upon appointment to the position. SRW Program Committee The student chairs, in collaboration with the faculty advisors, assemble a list of reviewers. The student chairs invite the reviewers to serve on the SRW program committee. Call for Papers Sample calls for student papers appear in CFP for student research workshop at ACL-17 . Mentoring If the student chairs and the faculty advisors decide on a mentorship program for student papers, the student chairs recruit mentors (first among the program committee) and assign them student mentees. Mentorship can take the form of pre-submission mentorship, to give feedback on the quality of writing and presentation prior to submission, and/or post-acceptance mentorship, to provide feedback to students in the form of in-depth comments and questions during the conference. Travel Grant Recommendation If funds are available to support student travel, the student chairs, in collaboration with the faculty advisors, gather requests for funding from students and make recommendations for funding allocation, to be approved by the ACL Treasurer. Proceedings Proceedings are printed and distributed by the ACL.

This position bridges the gap between the conference organizing committee, program chairs, and the OpenReview development team. By understanding the intricacies of the OpenReview system, the TORC ensures smooth operation and communication during the peer review process, addressing technical issues and facilitating a seamless experience for users. Key Responsibilities Proceedings Generation One of the primary responsibilities of the TORC is to assist in generating the conference proceedings using the ACLPUB tool ( source here ). This involves coordinating with program chairs to compile accepted papers and ensuring they are correctly formatted and published. Explore the information at acl-org/ACLPUB : The official tool for creating proceedings for conferences of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). Communication Facilitation The TORC plays a crucial role in facilitating communication among stakeholders. This includes: Creating and managing groups within the OpenReview platform, such as those needed for specific conference venues. Coordinating between various parties to ensure everyone is aligned on the review and submission process. Ticket Management The TORC oversees the Freshdesk ticket management system, which serves as a support mechanism for Open Review users, predominantly editors and program chairs. If faced with issues beyond their purview, the TORC liaises with OpenReview developers, primarily Jonathan Kummerfeld and Vitor, to resolve problems efficiently. Freshdesk (ARR) Mailing list Workshop Assistance The TORC plays a crucial role in providing technical support to workshop organizers, ensuring they are proficient in using the OpenReview platform and resolving any related queries. By assisting the workshop organizers, the TORC helps alleviate the workload of OpenReview developers and the main conference chairs, allowing them to focus on higher-level tasks and issues. For Conference/Workshop Organizers \u2013 ACL Rolling Review \u2013 A peer review platform for the Association for Computational Linguistics FAQ Management Maintaining a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) platform is another essential duty of the TORC. This resource serves as a knowledge base for users to resolve common issues independently, thus streamlining the support process and reducing repetitive queries. Recommended Practices Advance Requests : It is recommended to submit OpenReview requests for the commitment site a minimum of three weeks in advance. For example, for ACL 2024 which commitment date was on April 20th, requests should be made by April 1st. FAQ Q1: At what stages of the reviewing process is the Technical OR Chair most needed? A1: The TORC is more involved during the rolling review cycling stage. During the commitment site phase, regular meetings with the OpenReview team may not be necessary, and direct communication with key contacts (Jonathan and Vitor) can suffice for specific issues. Q2: How does the TORC contribute to conference venue management on OpenReview? A2: The TORC can create and manage new groups within a conference venue on OpenReview, ensuring that all relevant parties have the appropriate access and permissions. Q3: What should be done if a technical issue arises that the TORC cannot resolve? A3: If the TORC encounters an issue they cannot solve, they are advised to open a ticket on the Freshdesk system and, if necessary, contact the OpenReview developers through the same. Tutorial Development There is an ongoing effort to develop a comprehensive tutorial that details the role and responsibilities of the TORC, which should be updated annually by the designated TORC individual. Setup of the Commitment Site The OpenReview Co-Chairs are primarily responsible for setting up and maintaining the commitment site. To initiate the process, they should submit a request via the following link. It is recommended to follow the configuration settings used for previous *ACL venues. For further assistance, please contact the ARR technical team or OpenReview support. Link to submit a request: Creating your Venue Instance The request form created for ACL 2025: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DU7DNvflRqxgYmVYZFHW4gmqIs24aw98/view?usp=drive_link) OpenReview contact: info@openreview.net ( Contact ) Q4: Why the commitment request form chooses \"our venue does not have Ethics Chairs and Reviewers\" A4: The ethics chairs and reviewers were done within ARR, not within the *ACL commitment site. Q5: Other Important Information A5 from Steven Bethard: You do not need to set up anything on the development server. We did that to test things out before setting it up on the real server because no one provided us with a template for the site, but if you\u2019re following our template, practicing on the development server is probably unnecessary since you\u2019re unlikely to change much.

When appropriate, the tutorial chair can recruit a small committee to help evaluate the proposals and make final decisions. In years when more than one person co-chair, this might not be necessary. In recent years, the selection of tutorials has been made in unison with other conferences such as NAACL, EACL, AACL, EMNLP, etc. as appropriate. This helps ensure a variety of topics across conference locations and creates a more diverse pool for submissions. However, the conference-specific tutorial chair will need to coordinate with the local chair to understand room availability (e.g., how many tutorials are there room for). Thus, the tutorial chairs then become a defacto committee for tutorials across all conferences. Hopefully the chairs have been selected so that there are a variety of skills represented on the committee so that all tutorials can be fairly evaluated. If not, it may be useful to solicit external reviews (however, make sure to allow sufficient time for this in your calendar). Information about recent tutorials and attendance can be used to decide which tutorials are likely to be of interest. Balance between different topic areas and diversity in presenters is desirable, but not strictly necessary. One downside of the committee structure for tutorials is that the first conference in the calendar has a more rushed timeframe.

After tutorials have been selected, more responsibility devolves to the conference specific tutorial chairs, who are responsible for collecting one page tutorial abstracts and materials for the proceedings. Tutorial submissions often vary greatly in depth, concreteness, and thoroughness, so the tutorial chair should make expectations (both what is required and when it is required) clear upon acceptance to give the tutorial authors enough time to respond to requests.

Once the workshops for a given conference have been identified, the Workshop Chair is responsible for arranging dates, locations, refreshments, presentation and computer requirements, and all other special needs. It is essential that the Workshop Chair recognizes the different kinds of workshops and understand the policies regarding each. There are several categories of ACL workshops: Workshops associated with conferences and formally sponsored by an ACL SIG. Workshops associated with conferences but not formally sponsored by an ACL SIG. Workshops formally sponsored by an ACL SIG but not associated with an ACL conference. Workshops that are neither formally sponsored by a SIG nor associated with an ACL conference. Refer to the following documents to understand the policies related to workshop organization. The ACL General Policies on Workshops provides a set of policies that apply in general to all workshops. The ACL Policies on Conference Workshops provides additional policies that govern workshops held in conjunction with ACL conferences. The ACL Policies on SIG Workshops provides additional policies that govern workshops formally sponsored by ACL SIGs, whether or not they are held in conjunction with an ACL conference. The call for workshop proposals should request that workshop organizers ask potential members of their proposed program committees to agree to serve, before submitting a workshop proposal. Before accepting a workshop proposal, the workshop chair should check with individual workshop organizers to make sure that the proposed members of the program committee have agreed to serve. Large SIGs are expected to seek pre-approval for their workshops. The workshops must be self-financing (at least); profits belong to ACL (an exception is for SIG workshops --- see ACL-policy-on-Sig-workshops ). Sample spreadsheets are available for collecting information about the requirements of different workshops and communicating them to the local organizers. Step-by-step Guide for Workshop Chairs The goal of this document is to describe in a chronological manner the tasks and responsibilities of workshop chairs for ACL/EMNLP/NAACL/EACL/AACL. While each workshop chair might have their idea of how to perform their duties, this is designed to help \u201cautomate\u201d the overall tasks and reduce the overall time needed to perform this important task. Initial Coordination (circa June) Read this document, the ACL workshop chair handbook. Talk to the ACL Office and last year\u2019s workshop chairs to get some initial bearings. Create a mailing list for all workshops chairs of the calendar year (two per conference). This can help researchers reach out to all workshop chairs and aid coordination between the different conferences of the year. Example: workshop-chairs- @googlegroups.com Note: sometimes EMNLP chairs are selected late and some of the initial coordination will be performed without them. Obtain registration and attendance statistics from recent years (through the ACL Office and last year\u2019s chairs). This helps estimate the size of a workshop, which is important when assigning workshops to venues. Venues have different capacities and so it is important to have large/medium/small workshops distributed across venues in a reasonable manner. Find out the layout of the venue (how many rooms and their capacity). Usually there are about 8 rooms of varying sizes each day for the workshops Call for proposals (July-September) Write a call for workshop proposals jointly with all workshop chairs. Example call. First call should go out around July, Second call around August, and final call in September. Submission deadline should be 6-8 months before the first conference of the year. It is advisable to mention in the call that workshops can be 2 days only if they have a large number (>100) of participants for two continuous years. Set up a SoftConf START system through the Softconf support. Tweak the submission interface to your liking. Workshop organizers should make it clear what are their venue preferences and whether there are hard constraints (we will not hold the workshop if it is in venue X). This should be clear from the submission interface. Workshop selection (October-November) This is probably the most time-consuming period for the workshops chairs. Large workshops are pre-admitted: *SEM, WMT, CoNLL, other workshops that will have more than 100 participants (SemEval). However, the chairs need to get their venue preferences for the year. Traditionally, workshop selection was done by recruiting a program committee. In 2016-2017 about 60 workshops proposals were submitted, so this means that if each proposal receives 2 reviews and each committee member reviews 4 workshop proposals, a committee of 30 reviewers is needed. This is a process similar to choosing a conference program. In 2017, we opted for a different methodology. The main reasons were: Criteria for workshop selection is vague and so having a large program committee reduces fairness. Rejection rate increased to ~40-50%. An important criterion is public interest and that is not gauged well in the current model. Instead we performed the following changes: Online survey: Hold an online survey among ACL members (get mailing list from the ACL Office) asking them to indicate which workshops they would likely attend. This process also helps workshop organizers put up a website early and advertise the upcoming workshops to the ACL community. After results of the survey are in, each workshop chair reviews 1/6 of the proposals and comments on them. Then a discussion among all workshops chairs and they jointly decide the selected workshops. Considerations include Interest in the past Interest according to online survey Diversity Quality of organizing team Size of workshop Novelty Survey e-mail sent to ACL members. For more details see this document (TBA) Code and scripts for setting up the online survey are here (TBA) Workshop assignments: after workshops are chosen they are assigned to the different venues and are given a date. Rejection and acceptance e-mails are sent. At this point the joint work of all workshops chairs is mostly over and each pair of workshop chairs take care of their own conference. Workshop organization (From December) This part is mostly coordinating with the workshop organizers, general chair, publication chair and conference handbook chair. For most questions related to the venue, registration and ISBN numbers, the ACL Office is probably the best person to ask. For SoftConf related issues, the program chair is the best person to ask. For proceeding and handbook, it is best to email publication and handbook chairs on the same email thread. Consider cc\u2019ing the general chair, program chairs and the ACL Office on some important emails to keep everyone on the same page. Send the list of accepted workshops to the website chair so that they are put on the website. Coordinate with the general chair of the conference to get the important dates for all workshops (submission deadline, notification deadline, camera-ready deadline, proceeding deadline). Check carefully with all publication chairs to make sure proceeding deadline is early enough and has several days for buffer; this is the most crucial date. Decide on a date when the workshop organizers must assemble the schedule and materials for the conference handbook. The material is sent to the conference handbook chair. This is not flexible usually. Towards the deadline (~1-1.5 months before the conference) there is likely to be some correspondence between workshop organizers and the handbook chair about the exact format needed from the workshop organizers. Let the workshop organizers be responsible for assembling the proceedings of their workshop and coordinate with the publication chair. How to instructions. Ask the program chair whether they are setting SoftConf START accounts for all the workshops. If not, workshops organizers need to know they should do it. Write a progress report for ACL executives when asked by the general chair. Prepare a coordination sheet for all the conference workshops. This will contain at least the following information by the end of the conference and needs to be verified by the workshop organizers: Official workshop name Exact name of the proceedings URL of workshop website Abbreviation for SoftConf link (program chair) Contacts for all workshop organizers Number of posters and time when they are needed ACL ID prefix for ACL anthology (publication chair) ISBN: after confirming the exact name of the proceedings, ask the ACL Office to issue ISBN numbers, then rally the ISBN numbers back to the workshop organizers for them to add into proceedings. Announce the size of posters for the workshops (ask the ACL Office about the size; it could be different from the main conference) Usually each workshop waives registration fee for one invited speaker. This can also be managed in the coordination sheet. Coordinate with the ACL Office and announce the schedule for the workshops: start time, end time, break and meal times. All workshops should have the exact time for meals and breaks. This is very important as otherwise it is very hard to coordinate breaks for all workshops. Example: Breakfast 7:30-9:00 am Start time: between 8:30 and 9:00 am Mid-morning coffee/decaf/tea refresh: 10:30-11:00 am Lunch: 12:30-2:00 pm Mid-afternoon Snacks: 3:30-4:00 pm End of day: 5:00-6:00 pm (preferably by 5:30) Remind workshop organizers about the handbook and especially the proceedings deadline (two weeks and four days before due dates) and include handbook and publication chairs in the same email thread. Ask handbook and publication chairs how do they want the schedule and proceedings submitted. Usually you may pass down the instructions from the handbook chair to the workshop organizers; while due to the complexity of proceedings, it is better for the publication chairs to directly send instructions and communicate with the workshop organizers.
