## Overview of Responsibilities

The Website and Conference App* Chairs at *CL conferences are responsible for building the conference website, including posting calls for papers, conference schedules, announcements, and other information (*see *General Notes*).

Since the content on our conference websites is generally static, GitHub Pages rendered using Jekyll is the usual hosting option. The code for the website should be made public under an open-source license so that it can be reused by future conferences.

**The following are the main responsibilities of the Website and Conference App Chairs:**

**1. Acquire Website Resources from the Previous Year**\
**2. Update General Information for the New Conference**\
**3. Gather and Update Detailed Information**


**General Notes** : 
* Google is blocked in some regions. For this reason, it is advised to use other methods for collecting information where appropriate.
* There are two ways to post information: as a static page or as a blog post. Some conferences made heavy use of the blog while some did not have a blog at all. Choose the one most suitable for the conference.
* Most people use the website on mobile data, so try to compress multimedia contents such as images
* Website chairs used to be responsible for a conference app, but this was obsoleted by the virtual conference system, namely Underline and Gather.town, which are not handled by Website chairs. Please confirm the responsibility with the General Chair.
