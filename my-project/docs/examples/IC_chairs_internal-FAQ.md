Finding are not required to register their paper or present at the conference. But if they want to attend, they must register.

We ask that all papers upload a poster and a video so that the conference registrants can engage with the paper even if the authors are not registered for the conference. Please upload it to Underline before July 25, 2024.

Findings papers will appear in the proceedings (ACL Anthology) whether they are presented at the conference or not.

Best regards,
