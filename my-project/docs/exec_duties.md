# Actions and duties of the Exec in overseeing the conference

Certain matters require approval or other actions by the ACL Exec:

- Review and issue Call for Bids for the conference (properly, this is performed by the Exec, who traditionally appoints the Vice President to do so).
- Review the conference bids and accept one of them. This necessarily includes selecting the Local Organization Chair, the location, and the date of the conference.
- Identify remaining key organizers, notably the General Chair and the Program Co-chairs (see [selecting chairs](selecting_chairs.md))
- Sign a contract with venue(s) (hotel, conference center, etc.). Traditionally, this is done by the ACL Treasurer.
- Set approximate registration deadlines and costs.
- Review and approve the sub-chairs suggested by the conference General Chair, such as the tutorial chair, the workshop chair, the publications chair, the student research workshop chair, etc
- Request occasional updates on the conference budget and current state of affairs from the General Chair.
- Review the status of local organization and request updates from the Local Organization Chair.
