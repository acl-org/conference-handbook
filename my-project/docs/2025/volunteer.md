## Overview of Responsibilities  
Student Volunteers (SVs) are the on‑the‑ground backbone of *ACL conferences – staffing registration, session rooms, and special events while gaining professional experience and financial support. 

The Student Volunteer Chairs are responsible for coordinating the SV selection process and acting as the primary point of contact between student volunteers/applicants and event administration.

Student volunteers are typically asked for **10 hours of work**in exchange for free conference registration, ACL membership for the current year, workshops, tutorials, and social events.


**The following are the main responsibilities of the Student Volunteer Chairs:**

**1. Planning**   
**2. Recruitment & Selection**   
**3. Communications with Volunteers**

\* If students require further funding for travel and accommodation, this is **not** included in the Student Volunteering package and students should be encouraged to apply for Diversity & Inclusion grants to cover these costs.

## Breakdown of Responsibilities

### 1. Planning
This responsibility establishes the scope of the SV selection process. SV Chairs should contact the previous year’s chairs to review materials, gather templates, and incorporate lessons learned. They also should contact the event assistant to confirm the expected number of in-person, reserve, and virtual volunteers in advance, which guides selection planning and applicant communication. Coordination with the Diversity & Inclusion and Visa Chairs is recommended early on to help maximize equitable distribution of volunteer slots and ensure timely support for applicants requiring visas.

### 2. Recruitment & Selection  
This responsibility concerns opening the Call for Volunteers, collecting applications, and selecting a group of volunteers along with a small reserve list. SV Chairs should adapt and validate the application form, coordinate with the event assistant, and disseminate the call well in advance of the deadline.
Selection criteria are determined by the SV Chairs and may include factors such as paper authorship at the main conference or workshops, financial need, geographic diversity, previous volunteer experience, and first-time *ACL attendance. The call should specify volunteer availability expectations (e.g., be present for the full conference, including the day before the conference for registration).

### 3. Communications with Volunteers

This responsibility involves managing all communication channels and correspondence with student volunteers throughout the process. SV Chairs handle a high volume of emails and requests, requiring organized communication systems and clear protocols.

**Communication Setup:**
Prior to opening the call for volunteers, SV Chairs should establish a shared email address managed by both chairs or create a Google Group to be published on the ACL website. This official email address is essential for all communication processes. Using a dedicated email account prevents personal accounts from being blocked due to high email volume and ensures continuity of communication.

**Notification Process:**
After the selection process, SV Chairs send acceptance/rejection notifications with attached letters to four categories of volunteers: accepted in-person, accepted virtual, shortlisted, and rejected. Templates for these notification letters are provided by the event manager to ensure consistency and professionalism.

**Communication Management:**
To streamline communication, SV Chairs should send a FAQ email to all volunteers addressing common questions and concerns. The FAQ should specify a communication format for volunteer emails, such as "Name_Surname_Role_RequestKeyword" to facilitate efficient processing and response.

**Peak Communication Periods:**
The highest volume of communication occurs between acceptance notifications and the early registration deadline. During this period, volunteers typically have questions about logistics, requirements, and procedures. Additionally, significant communication with the event manager is required to report special situations and volunteer withdrawals.

**Role Change Requests:**
Many communication requests involve volunteers asking to switch their role (e.g., from in-person to virtual). To minimize these requests, SV Chairs should clearly specify role change policies and limitations directly in the acceptance email.
